A small green female called Teenie Weenie lived inside the bucket.\nA witch called Dolly Clackhanger would try to steal the bucket from Bimble, many times, for her queen, Kak. She usually sent her gang to steal it. They consist of two Sleazians from Sleaze City who look like punk rockers called Bilge and Oiler, who usually go around on motorised pogo sticks. Dolly also has an odd looking blue creature with green hair called Sploot, who is usually Dolly's guinea pig for her magical experiments.\nQueen Kak is also assisted by her tax collector Mudge, another Sleazian wearing a pork pie hat. He would rather perform scientific experiments instead of collecting taxes for the queen, and he dislikes Dolly and her magic.\nThe show ran for 2 series between 1996 and 1997.\nThe series was later repeated on the Sky Digital channel Pop.\n\u5bbe\u6ce2\u5728\u6551\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u9677\u5230\u6ce5\u6f6d\u91cc\u7684\u795e\u79d8\u7684\u964c\u751f\u4eba\u4e4b\u540e\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7b54\u8c22\uff0c\u90a3\u4e2a\u4eba\u628a\u6234\u5728\u5934\u4e0a\u7684\u6876\u9001\u7ed9\u4e86\u5bbe\u6ce2\u3002\u6876\u91cc\u9762\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b88\u536b\u8005\uff0c\u53ebTeeny Weeny(\u610f\u4e3a\u201c\u6781\u5c0f\u6781\u5c0f\u7684\uff02)\u3002\u5bbe\u6ce2\u5f88\u5feb\u5c31\u53d1\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6876\u5177\u6709\u9b54\u529b\uff0c\u5b83\u80fd\u5e26\u7ed9\u4ed6\u60f3\u8981\u7684\u4efb\u4f55\u4e1c\u897f\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u53ea\u80fd\u7ef4\u630124\u5c0f\u65f6\u3002\u4f46\u662f\u8fd9\u4e2a\u9b54\u6876\u4e5f\u6210\u4e86\u591a\u8389(Dolly Clackhanger)\u68a6\u60f3\u5f97\u5230\u7684\u5bf9\u8c61\uff0c\u591a\u8389\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u88ab\u6751\u5b50\u6d41\u653e\u7684\u3001\u5145\u6ee1\u62a5\u590d\u5fc3\u7684\u3001\u6b63\u5728\u4fee\u70bc\u7684\u5973\u5deb\u3002\u5979\u5e0c\u671b\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e2a\u9b54\u6876\u7684\u529b\u91cf\u4f7f\u81ea\u5df1\u6210\u4e3a\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u5973\u5deb\u3002\u4f46\u662f\u591a\u8389\u4e0d\u77e5\u9053\uff0c\u5979\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u65b0\u52a9\u624b\uff0c\u6bd4\u5c14\u5179(Bilge)\u548c\u5965\u5c14\u52d2(Oiler)\uff0c\u5176\u5b9e\u662f\u90a3\u4e2a\u9ecf\u80f6\u5973\u738b\u5361\u67ef(Kak)\u7684\u4ec6\u4eba\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u662f\u88ab\u6d3e\u5230\u591a\u5229\u8eab\u8fb9\uff0c\u76d1\u89c6\u5979\u7684\u529b\u91cf\u548c\u5bf9\u5973\u738b\u7684\u5a01\u80c1\u7684\u3002\u5bbe\u6ce2\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u81ea\u5df1\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u9b54\u6876\uff0c\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\u610f\u5473\u7740\u81ea\u5df1\u88ab\u6307\u6d3e\u4e3aStiltsville(\u6ce8\uff1aStiltsville\u662f\u5b58\u5728\u7684\uff0c\u4f4d\u4e8e\u7f8e\u56fd\u7684\u7f8e\u56fd\u7684\u798f\u7f57\u91cc\u8fbe\u5dde)\u548c\u8fd9\u513f\u7684\u7f8a\u6bdb\u7684\u5b88\u62a4\u8005\uff0c\u800c\u8fd9\u513f\u7684\u7f8a\u6bdb\u662f\u5168\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u795e\u8bdd\u6545\u4e8b\u7684\u6e90\u6cc9\u3002", "ticket_price_info": "", "vendor_icons": [], "year": "1996", "card_subtitle": "1996 / \u82f1\u56fd / \u5267\u60c5 \u52a8\u753b / Michael Jupp", "forum_info": null, "webisode": null, "id": "4058890", "is_restrictive": false, "gallery_topic_count": 0, "languages": ["\u666e\u901a\u8bdd/\u56fd\u8bed", "\u82f1\u8bed"], "genres": ["\u5267\u60c5", "\u52a8\u753b"], "can_interact": true, "review_count": 1, "title": "\u5bbe\u6ce2\u7684\u9b54\u6876", "has_linewatch": false, "ugc_tabs": [{"source": "reviews", "type": "review", "title": "\u5267\u8bc4"}, {"source": "forum_topics", "type": "forum", "title": "\u8ba8\u8bba"}], "forum_topic_count": 2, "webview_info": {}, "is_released": true, "vendors": [], "actors": [], "interest": null, "episodes_count": 26, "color_scheme": {"is_dark": true, "primary_color_light": "6f6672", "_base_color": [0.792, 0.108, 0.145], "secondary_color": "f8f4f9", "_avg_color": [0.792, 0.108, 0.145], "primary_color_dark": "4a444c"}, "type": "tv", "null_rating_reason": "", "linewatches": [], "info_url": "https://www.douban.com/doubanapp//h5/movie/4058890/desc", "tags": [{"url": "https://www.douban.com/channel/30307619", "uri": "douban://douban.com/channel/30307619", "id": "30307619", "is_channel": true, "name": "\u7ae5\u5e74\u52a8\u753b"}], "durations": [], "comment_count": 172, "cover": null, "cover_url": "https://img9.doubanio.com/view/subject/l/public/s3996539.jpg", "restrictive_icon_url": "", "header_bg_color": "4a444c", "is_douban_intro": false, "honor_infos": [], "sharing_url": "https://movie.douban.com/subject/4058890/", "wechat_timeline_share": "screenshot", "countries": ["\u82f1\u56fd"], "url": "https://movie.douban.com/subject/4058890/", "release_date": null, "original_title": "Bimble's Bucket", "uri": "douban://douban.com/tv/4058890", "pre_playable_date": null, "episodes_info": "", "subtype": "tv", "directors": [], "is_show": false, "in_blacklist": false, "pre_release_desc": "", "video": null, "aka": [], "webisode_count": 0, "trailer": null, "scrap_count": 1}
