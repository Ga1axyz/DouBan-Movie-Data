The director found Dimitri in Germany and, after agreeing to pay him a thousand pounds, began filming. After their first meeting, the director thought that Dimitri \"had grown a beard to look more like a Dostoevsky and I thought, a great face, great character, he could be a good key to the East/West situation today.\"\nDimitri is invited to Germany by the members of the Dostoevsky Society. He is asked to give a series of lectures about his great grandfather. He knows little about his illustrious ancestor, and his only ambition is to earn enough money to buy a Mercedes. Dimitri feels burdened by his relative's status, because everybody expects him to be a 'prophet', just as Fyodor was considered to be. The film blends real events with fictional elements; the meeting of Dimitri Dostoevsky and Count Tolstoy in London is accompanied by a voiceover explaining that Fyodor and Leo never met, suggesting that Dimitri's story might itself be a fiction. Perhaps, we wonder, the whole film is a trick, and Dimitri nothing more than a conman.\nDostoevsky's Travels ruminates on the collapse of the Soviet Union and Russia's transition to capitalism. Dimitri's yearning for material goods is hilarious, remarkable and full of pathos.", "webisode_count": 0, "year": "1991", "card_subtitle": "1991 / \u82f1\u56fd / \u4f20\u8bb0 \u7eaa\u5f55\u7247 / \u5e15\u7ef4\u4e4c\u00b7\u5e15\u592b\u5229\u79d1\u592b\u65af\u57fa / Dimitri Dostoevsky Dorota Kwiatkowska", "id": "25788361", "languages": ["\u82f1\u8bed", "\u5fb7\u8bed", "\u4fc4\u8bed"], "genres": ["\u4f20\u8bb0", "\u7eaa\u5f55\u7247"], "title": "\u9640\u601d\u59a5\u8036\u592b\u65af\u57fa\u6b27\u6e38\u8bb0", "is_released": true, "vendors": [], "actors": [{"name": "Dorota Kwiatkowska", "roles": ["\u6f14\u5458"], "title": "Dorota Kwiatkowska\uff08\u540c\u540d\uff09\u6ce2\u5170,\u534e\u6c99\u5f71\u89c6\u6f14\u5458", "url": "https://movie.douban.com/celebrity/1102513/", "uri": "douban://douban.com/celebrity/1102513?subject_id=27308323", "avatar": {"large": "https://img9.doubanio.com/view/celebrity/raw/public/p1470140896.9.jpg", "normal": "https://img9.doubanio.com/view/celebrity/raw/public/p1470140896.9.jpg"}, "sharing_url": "https://www.douban.com/doubanapp/dispatch?uri=/celebrity/1102513/", "type": "celebrity", "id": "1102513", "latin_name": "", "movies": [{"id": "25788361", "title": "\u9640\u601d\u59a5\u8036\u592b\u65af\u57fa\u6b27\u6e38\u8bb0", "original_title": "Dostoevsky's Travels", "year": "1991", "is_tv": false, "rating": null, "poster": "https://img9.doubanio.com/view/photo/m_ratio_poster/public/p2872064226.webp"}], "_id": {"$oid": "632a11f514d1eac09edd1588"}}], "episodes_count": 0, "type": "movie", "null_rating_reason": "\u6682\u65e0\u8bc4\u5206", "linewatches": [], "info_url": "https://www.douban.com/doubanapp//h5/movie/25788361/desc", "tags": [], "durations": ["50 min."], "cover": {"description": "", "author": {"loc": null, "kind": "user", "name": "\u5e74\u5c11\u5982\u98ce97604", "url": "https://www.douban.com/people/199346306/", "reg_time": "2019-07-08 22:00:10", "uri": "douban://douban.com/user/199346306", "avatar_side_icon_id": "", "avatar": "https://img9.doubanio.com/icon/up199346306-1.jpg", "id": "199346306", "type": "user", "avatar_side_icon": "", "uid": "199346306"}, "url": "https://movie.douban.com/photos/photo/2872064226/", "image": {"large": {"url": "https://img9.doubanio.com/view/photo/l/public/p2872064226.webp", "width": 1000, "height": 1500, "size": 0}, "raw": null, "small": {"url": "https://img9.doubanio.com/view/photo/s/public/p2872064226.webp", "width": 400, "height": 600, "size": 0}, "is_animated": false, "normal": {"url": "https://img9.doubanio.com/view/photo/m/public/p2872064226.webp", "width": 400, "height": 600, "size": 0}}, "uri": "douban://douban.com/photo/2872064226", "create_time": "2022-04-25 22:25:38", "position": 0, "owner_uri": "douban://douban.com/movie/25788361", "type": "photo", "id": "2872064226", "sharing_url": "https://www.douban.com/doubanapp/dispatch?uri=/photo/2872064226/"}, "cover_url": "https://img9.doubanio.com/view/photo/m_ratio_poster/public/p2872064226.webp", "restrictive_icon_url": "", "header_bg_color": "4c3425", "honor_infos": [], "sharing_url": "https://movie.douban.com/subject/25788361/", "subject_collections": [], "countries": ["\u82f1\u56fd"], "url": "https://movie.douban.com/subject/25788361/", "release_date": null, "original_title": "Dostoevsky's Travels", "uri": "douban://douban.com/movie/25788361", "episodes_info": "", "subtype": "movie", "directors": [{"name": "\u5e15\u7ef4\u4e4c\u00b7\u5e15\u592b\u5229\u79d1\u592b\u65af\u57fa", "roles": ["\u5bfc\u6f14", "\u7f16\u5267", "\u5236\u7247\u4eba", "\u6f14\u5458"], "title": "\u5e15\u7ef4\u4e4c\u00b7\u5e15\u592b\u5229\u79d1\u592b\u65af\u57fa\uff08\u540c\u540d\uff09\u6ce2\u5170,\u534e\u6c99\u5f71\u89c6\u6f14\u5458", "url": "https://movie.douban.com/celebrity/1294136/", "user": null, "character": "\u5bfc\u6f14", "uri": "douban://douban.com/celebrity/1294136?subject_id=27522414", "avatar": {"large": "https://img9.doubanio.com/view/personage/raw/public/a40fb24998ccc5db4a4d5f1521319295.jpg", "normal": "https://img9.doubanio.com/view/personage/raw/public/a40fb24998ccc5db4a4d5f1521319295.jpg"}, "sharing_url": "https://www.douban.com/doubanapp/dispatch?uri=/celebrity/1294136/", "type": "celebrity", "id": "1294136", "latin_name": "Pawel Pawlikowski"}], "is_show": false, "in_blacklist": false, "pre_release_desc": "", "video": null, "aka": ["\u9640\u601d\u59a5\u8036\u592b\u65af\u57fa\u6b27\u6e38\u8bb0"], "is_restrictive": false, "trailer": null, "vendor_icons": [], "extra": {"douban_id": "25788361", "imdb_id": "tt0130631", "backdrops": []}}
