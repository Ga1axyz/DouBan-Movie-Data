Adults were not allowed, as this sketch show was performed by teenagers from the Central Junior Television Workshop in Nottingham. Featuring some very memorable (but by now, dated) spoofs on shows from that era, including Tweeman instead of He-Man (By the power of Numskull) and Berky Jones replacing Indiana. \"StreetHawk\" became \"Street Budgie\", \"The A-Team\" turned into \"The Z-team\", and \"No 73\" was re-imagined as \"No Eleventythree\".\nAll these parodies were supposed to be broadcast by the underage crew of a television station, with the accident prone Loaf (Ian Kirby) always botching things up. Reporter 'The Wimp' (Simon Schatzberger) was replaced in the second season by a serial called \"Palace Hill\" (three guesses which show this was based on), starring two enormously eared princes called Harry and William. (the real princes were still toddlers at the time). Won a Bafta in the Best Light Entertainment/Drama category and second prize in the Prix Danube international Children's Festival in Czechoslovakia in 1987. After the third and final series Palace Hill got it's own spin off in 1988, at which time even mother started to enjoy it.", "webisode_count": 0, "year": "1985-1988", "card_subtitle": "1985-1988 / \u82f1\u56fd / Ian Kirkby Paul Stark", "id": "24700656", "languages": ["\u82f1\u8bed"], "genres": [], "title": "Your Mother Wouldn't Like It \u7b2c\u4e00\u5b63", "is_released": true, "vendors": [], "actors": [], "episodes_count": 21, "type": "tv", "null_rating_reason": "\u6682\u65e0\u8bc4\u5206", "linewatches": [], "info_url": "https://www.douban.com/doubanapp//h5/movie/24700656/desc", "tags": [], "durations": ["25 min"], "cover": null, "cover_url": "https://img9.doubanio.com/f/frodo/568eb8fac54d39fe599b0de8c3f2aee1dbc43cf0/pics/subject/tv_large.jpg", "restrictive_icon_url": "", "header_bg_color": "4a444c", "honor_infos": [], "sharing_url": "https://movie.douban.com/subject/24700656/", "subject_collections": [], "countries": ["\u82f1\u56fd"], "url": "https://movie.douban.com/subject/24700656/", "release_date": null, "original_title": "Your Mother Wouldn't Like It Season 1", "uri": "douban://douban.com/tv/24700656", "episodes_info": "", "subtype": "tv", "directors": [], "is_show": false, "in_blacklist": false, "pre_release_desc": "", "video": null, "aka": [], "is_restrictive": false, "trailer": null, "vendor_icons": [], "extra": {"douban_id": "24700656", "imdb_id": "tt0159228", "backdrops": []}, "f_tags": ["1985-1988", "\u82f1\u56fd", "Ian", "Kirkby", "Paul", "Stark"]}
