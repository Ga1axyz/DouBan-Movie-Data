We have forgotten the undeniable truth that everything is connected. PLANETARY is a provocative and breathtaking wakeup call, a cross continental, cinematic journey, that explores our cosmic origins and our future as a species. PLANETARY is a poetic and humbling reminder that it's time to shift our perspective. PLANETARY asks us to rethink who we really are, to reconsider our relationship with ourselves, each other and the world around us - to remember that: we are PLANETARY. In a stunning visual exploration, the film interweaves imagery from NASA Apollo missions with visions of the Milky Way, Buddhist monasteries in the Himalayas, and the cacophonous sounds of downtown Tokyo and Manhattan, with intimate interviews from renowned experts including astronauts Ron Garan and Mae Jemison (the first African American woman in space), celebrated environmentalist Bill McKibben, National Book Award winner Barry Lopez, anthropologist Wade Davis, to National Geographic Explorer Elizabeth Lindsey, and Head of the Tibetan Buddhist Kagyu school, the 17th Karmapa. They shed new light on the ways our worldview is profoundly affecting life on our planet.\n--from imdb", "vendor_icons": [], "year": "2015", "card_subtitle": "2015 / \u82f1\u56fd \u52a0\u62ff\u5927 \u5370\u5ea6 \u5370\u5ea6\u5c3c\u897f\u4e9a \u5c3c\u6cca\u5c14 \u5766\u6851\u5c3c\u4e9a \u7f8e\u56fd \u8d8a\u5357 / \u5386\u53f2 \u7eaa\u5f55\u7247 / Guy Reid / \u6797\u8d5b\u00b7\u4f0a\u4e3d\u838e\u767d Janine Benyus", "id": "26381678", "is_restrictive": false, "languages": ["\u82f1\u8bed"], "genres": ["\u5386\u53f2", "\u7eaa\u5f55\u7247"], "title": "\u884c\u661f", "is_released": true, "vendors": [], "actors": [{"name": "\u6797\u8d5b\u00b7\u4f0a\u4e3d\u838e\u767d"}, {"name": "Janine Benyus"}, {"name": "Ronald Garan"}, {"name": "Joan Halifax"}, {"name": "Paul Hawken"}, {"name": "The 17th Karmapa"}, {"name": "David Loy"}, {"name": "Joanna Macey"}, {"name": "Bill McKibben"}, {"name": "Subonfu Some"}], "episodes_count": 0, "type": "movie", "linewatches": [], "info_url": "https://www.douban.com/doubanapp//h5/movie/26381678/desc", "tags": [], "durations": ["85\u5206\u949f"], "cover": {"description": "", "author": {"loc": {"id": "128396", "name": "New York City", "uid": "newyorkcity"}, "kind": "user", "name": "\u61d0\u723e", "url": "https://www.douban.com/people/50722362/", "reg_time": "2011-04-09 01:13:07", "uri": "douban://douban.com/user/50722362", "avatar": "https://img9.doubanio.com/icon/up50722362-19.jpg", "id": "50722362", "type": "user", "avatar_side_icon": "", "uid": "v0409"}, "url": "https://movie.douban.com/photos/photo/2241998163/", "image": {"large": {"url": "https://img9.doubanio.com/view/photo/l/public/p2241998163.webp", "width": 966, "height": 1436, "size": 0}, "raw": null, "small": {"url": "https://img9.doubanio.com/view/photo/s/public/p2241998163.webp", "width": 403, "height": 600, "size": 0}, "is_animated": false, "normal": {"url": "https://img9.doubanio.com/view/photo/m/public/p2241998163.webp", "width": 403, "height": 600, "size": 0}}, "uri": "douban://douban.com/photo/2241998163", "create_time": "2015-05-04 14:04:46", "position": 0, "owner_uri": "douban://douban.com/movie/26381678", "type": "photo", "id": "2241998163", "sharing_url": "https://www.douban.com/doubanapp/dispatch?uri=/photo/2241998163/"}, "cover_url": "https://img9.doubanio.com/view/photo/m_ratio_poster/public/p2241998163.webp", "restrictive_icon_url": "", "header_bg_color": "31364c", "honor_infos": [], "trailer": null, "sharing_url": "https://movie.douban.com/subject/26381678/", "countries": ["\u82f1\u56fd", "\u52a0\u62ff\u5927", "\u5370\u5ea6", "\u5370\u5ea6\u5c3c\u897f\u4e9a", "\u5c3c\u6cca\u5c14", "\u5766\u6851\u5c3c\u4e9a", "\u7f8e\u56fd", "\u8d8a\u5357"], "url": "https://movie.douban.com/subject/26381678/", "release_date": null, "original_title": "Planetary", "uri": "douban://douban.com/movie/26381678", "episodes_info": "", "subtype": "movie", "directors": [{"name": "Guy Reid"}], "is_show": false, "in_blacklist": false, "pre_release_desc": "", "video": null, "aka": [], "webisode_count": 0, "null_rating_reason": "\u6682\u65e0\u8bc4\u5206", "extra": {"douban_id": "26381678", "imdb_id": "tt3473882", "backdrops": [""]}, "noneedrating": 1, "f_tags": ["2015", "\u82f1\u56fd", "\u52a0\u62ff\u5927", "\u5370\u5ea6", "\u5370\u5ea6\u5c3c\u897f\u4e9a", "\u5c3c\u6cca\u5c14", "\u5766\u6851\u5c3c\u4e9a", "\u7f8e\u56fd", "\u8d8a\u5357", "\u5386\u53f2", "\u7eaa\u5f55\u7247", "Guy", "Reid", "\u6797\u8d5b\u00b7\u4f0a\u4e3d\u838e\u767d", "Janine", "Benyus", "Guy Reid", "Janine Benyus", "Ronald Garan", "Joan Halifax", "Paul Hawken", "The 17th Karmapa", "David Loy", "Joanna Macey", "Bill McKibben", "Subonfu Some"]}
