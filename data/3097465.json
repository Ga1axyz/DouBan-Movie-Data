I went to theater to see some mind-blowing action. I was hoping that \u00c5ke Lindman had made something spectacular as his last movie. I also believed in his directing talents. Now I sadly have to say that the movie didn't fulfill my expectations.\nThe movie was a bit bouncing: Going there, doing that, coming back and going again. Different people fought in different places and sometimes it was hard to follow what was happening as a whole. Well this wasn't too disturbing as the movie still was entertaining. Especially all tank-scenes were amazing. The lack of money, which was clearly visible, was maybe the most disruptive thing in the movie. As mentioned in the movie, there were about 250 cannons and mortars, plus bomber planes, targeting the Tali-Ihantala area. But when the \"big fight\" came, it looked like about 10 guns were bombing the woods with smoke grenades (And I can say this because I have served in mortar company in the Finnish army). I'm sure it looked like that because there were not enough money to make it look realistic. I was also hoping more soldiers running in the woods because hey, it was supposed to be the biggest fight in the northern Europe!", "vendor_icons": [], "year": "2007", "card_subtitle": "2007 / \u82ac\u5170 / \u52a8\u4f5c \u5267\u60c5 \u6218\u4e89 / \u00c5ke Lindman / Rauno Ahonen Mikkomarkus Ahtiainen", "id": "3097465", "is_restrictive": false, "languages": ["\u82ac\u5170\u8bed", "\u745e\u5178\u8bed", "\u5fb7\u8bed"], "genres": ["\u52a8\u4f5c", "\u5267\u60c5", "\u6218\u4e89"], "can_interact": true, "title": "\u8840\u62181944", "is_released": true, "vendors": [], "actors": [{"name": "Rauno Ahonen"}, {"name": "Mikkomarkus Ahtiainen"}], "episodes_count": 0, "type": "movie", "null_rating_reason": "", "linewatches": [], "info_url": "https://www.douban.com/doubanapp//h5/movie/3097465/desc", "tags": [{"url": "https://www.douban.com/channel/30307833", "uri": "douban://douban.com/channel/30307833", "id": "30307833", "is_channel": true, "name": "\u4e8c\u6218"}, {"url": "https://www.douban.com/channel/30168698", "uri": "douban://douban.com/channel/30168698", "id": "30168698", "is_channel": true, "name": "\u6218\u4e89"}, {"url": "https://www.douban.com/channel/30307261", "uri": "douban://douban.com/channel/30307261", "id": "30307261", "is_channel": true, "name": "\u82ac\u5170"}, {"url": "https://www.douban.com/channel/30168934", "uri": "douban://douban.com/channel/30168934", "id": "30168934", "is_channel": true, "name": "\u5386\u53f2"}, {"url": "https://www.douban.com/channel/30307258", "uri": "douban://douban.com/channel/30307258", "id": "30307258", "is_channel": true, "name": "\u5317\u6b27"}, {"url": "https://www.douban.com/channel/30307286", "uri": "douban://douban.com/channel/30307286", "id": "30307286", "is_channel": true, "name": "\u4fc4\u7f57\u65af"}, {"url": "https://www.douban.com/channel/30307257", "uri": "douban://douban.com/channel/30307257", "id": "30307257", "is_channel": true, "name": "\u6b27\u6d32"}, {"url": "https://www.douban.com/channel/30307495", "uri": "douban://douban.com/channel/30307495", "id": "30307495", "is_channel": true, "name": "\u5267\u60c5\u7247"}], "durations": ["117 \u5206\u949f"], "cover": {"description": "", "author": {"loc": {"id": "118200", "name": "\u798f\u5dde", "uid": "fuzhou"}, "kind": "user", "name": "\u0192unc", "url": "https://www.douban.com/people/46972163/", "reg_time": "2010-10-27 15:33:08", "uri": "douban://douban.com/user/46972163", "avatar": "https://img9.doubanio.com/icon/up46972163-12.jpg", "id": "46972163", "type": "user", "avatar_side_icon": "", "uid": "F1006"}, "url": "https://movie.douban.com/photos/photo/2502966464/", "image": {"large": {"url": "https://img9.doubanio.com/view/photo/l/public/p2502966464.webp", "width": 531, "height": 750, "size": 0}, "raw": null, "small": {"url": "https://img9.doubanio.com/view/photo/s/public/p2502966464.webp", "width": 424, "height": 600, "size": 0}, "is_animated": false, "normal": {"url": "https://img9.doubanio.com/view/photo/m/public/p2502966464.webp", "width": 424, "height": 600, "size": 0}}, "uri": "douban://douban.com/photo/2502966464", "create_time": "2017-10-24 14:02:26", "position": 0, "owner_uri": "douban://douban.com/movie/3097465", "type": "photo", "id": "2502966464", "sharing_url": "https://www.douban.com/doubanapp/dispatch?uri=/photo/2502966464/"}, "cover_url": "https://img9.doubanio.com/view/photo/m_ratio_poster/public/p2502966464.webp", "restrictive_icon_url": "", "header_bg_color": "454c43", "honor_infos": [], "sharing_url": "https://movie.douban.com/subject/3097465/", "countries": ["\u82ac\u5170"], "url": "https://movie.douban.com/subject/3097465/", "release_date": null, "original_title": "Tali-Ihantala 1944", "uri": "douban://douban.com/movie/3097465", "episodes_info": "", "subtype": "movie", "directors": [{"name": "\u00c5ke Lindman"}], "is_show": false, "in_blacklist": false, "pre_release_desc": "", "video": null, "aka": ["\u5854\u91cc-\u4f0a\u6c49\u5854\u62c91944", "1944: The Final Defence"], "webisode_count": 0, "trailer": null, "extra": {"douban_id": "3097465", "imdb_id": "tt0378848", "backdrops": ["https://www.themoviedb.org/t/p/original/jUoJsdNAksofYogKCM14AER8qjd.jpg"]}, "f_tags": ["\u4e8c\u6218", "\u6218\u4e89", "\u82ac\u5170", "\u5386\u53f2", "\u5317\u6b27", "\u4fc4\u7f57\u65af", "\u6b27\u6d32", "\u5267\u60c5\u7247", "2007", "\u52a8\u4f5c", "\u5267\u60c5", "\u00c5ke", "Lindman", "Rauno", "Ahonen", "Mikkomarkus", "Ahtiainen", "\u00c5ke Lindman", "Rauno Ahonen", "Mikkomarkus Ahtiainen"]}
