There is also a full-time Covid-19 Supervisor on set to make sure the protocols are being implemented correctly and the latest guidance is incorporated into the policy. The health and safety of our cast and crew is paramount and production is working in line with the Guadeloupe advice as well as the industry guidelines.\nReturning to the sun-soaked island to reprise their roles are Ralf Little as D.I. Neville Parker, Don Warrington as Commissioner Selwyn Patterson, Tobi Bakare as D.S. JP Hooper and Elizabeth Bourgine as Mayor Catherine Bordey.\nAs well as the usual baffling murders, intriguing puzzles and famous guest stars, viewers can expect some huge surprises as the show celebrates a decade as one of the most loved British dramas - and these surprises begin with the return of D.S. Florence Cassell, played by audience favourite Josephine Jobert. Florence thinks she\u2019s ready to get back to work after her fianc\u00e9\u2019s death two years ago - but she hasn\u2019t banked on her new boss, Neville. As she tries to understand his peculiarities, sparks are bound to fly\u2026\nNeville soon realises he is existing in the Caribbean, rather than embracing life there. With Florence\u2019s help, he determines to seize the day and finds himself starting to reveal some of his secrets - including of a romantic nature. But is Neville really built for a life in the tropics? And is a romantic relationship ever going to be possible for him?\nAfter two series bringing law, order, and joy to the streets of Saint Marie, we\u2019re sad to say goodbye to Ruby Patterson who made such a massive impact in such a short time! DS Madeleine Dumas will also be departing Saint Marie\u2019s sunny shores and we would like to thank Shyko Amos and Aude Legastelois-Bid\u00e9 for bringing Ruby and Madeleine to life and wish them all the very best for the future.\nWe are excited to welcome a brand-new face to the team, in the shape of Tahj Miles. His character, 18-year-old petty criminal Marlon Pryce, is a ball of energy and thinks he knows it all. But when he runs into JP, his life takes an unexpected turn and he finds himself looking at a very different future to the one he expected.\nThe arrival of twins is the least of JP\u2019s challenges as he finds Marlon - and some shocking developments at work - testing him to his limits. Selwyn\u2019s frustrations with his new detective take a back seat when he finds himself in the firing line and Catherine\u2019s life is turned upside down when the death of a friend pulls her into grave danger.\nExecutive Producer, Tim Key, says: \u201cWe are delighted to be able to start filming and can\u2019t wait to celebrate our tenth series with our audience. It\u2019s a joy to be working with Josephine Jobert again and we think the viewers will love watching her trying to get to grips with Neville. And we are very happy to welcome Tahj Miles to the show. Marlon is going to make real waves once he arrives in Saint Marie. We\u2019ve got some real treats for our long-term viewers as the series progresses - including some major surprises and the possibility of another returning face or two. We are determined to make this our biggest and best series yet and can\u2019t wait to take our viewers back to Saint Marie in 2021.\u201d\nRed Planet Pictures' Joint Managing Director, Alex Jones, says: \u201cLike every other production company, we have faced huge challenges to get to this point, so we are delighted to be up and running again and extremely grateful to everyone who has helped us get this far, not least the people of Deshaies and the region of Guadeloupe for their assistance. The safety of our cast and crew - as well as our friends in Guadeloupe - is the most important thing to us and our policies have been designed to protect everybody whilst still delivering an amazing series for our tenth year.\u201d\nBBC Commissioning Editor, Tommy Bulfin, says: \u201cWe are so pleased that filming has started on this special tenth anniversary series of Death In Paradise. This series is packed-full of captivating cases and unexpected twists, as well as some really great surprises for fans of the show. Thanks so much to Red Planet Pictures for working so hard to make it happen.\u201d\nDeath In Paradise is a Red Planet Pictures production for BBC One made with the support of the region of Guadeloupe and internationally distributed by BBC Studios.
