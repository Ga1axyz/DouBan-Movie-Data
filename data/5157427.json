With original episodes presented exclusively on NBC this season, the two-hour show will air through the summer on Monday nights at 8:00 p.m. ET/PT. The finale will air Sept. 15 (8:00 p.m. ET/PT).\nMatt Iseman returns as host, along with former NFL player Akbar Gbaja-Biamila (NFL Network). Jenn Brown (NFL Network) serves as co-host.\nThe action-packed premiere follows competitors as they tackle a series of challenging obstacle courses in both qualifying and finals rounds across the country. Those that successfully complete a course in their designated region will move on to the national finals round in Las Vegas, where they face a stunning four-stage course modeled after the famed Mt. Midoriyama in Japan.\nThis season, the series will travel to five cities in search of the ultimate athlete - Los Angeles, Dallas, St. Louis, Miami and Denver - before heading to Las Vegas. Men and women from all walks of life will vie for the title of \"American Ninja Warrior,\" including school teachers and firemen, current and former members of the military, amateur sports enthusiasts and even a few Olympic gold medalists.\nIn order to guarantee a spot in the national finals, competitors must successfully complete the finals course in their respective city. From there, competitors will travel to Las Vegas and earn the chance to win the title of \"American Ninja Warrior,\" along with the $500,000 grand prize.\nBased on the global hit \"Sasuke,\" from the Tokyo Broadcasting System Television, the original series is in production for its 30th season and only three contestants have completed the course.\n\"American Ninja Warrior\" is executive produced by A. Smith & Co. Productions' founders Arthur Smith and Kent Weed (\"Hell's Kitchen,\" \"I Survived a Japanese Game Show,\" \"Pros vs. Joes\").", "webisode_count": 0, "year": "2009", "card_subtitle": "2009 / \u7f8e\u56fd / \u771f\u4eba\u79c0 / Patrick McManus / Matt Iseman Akbar Gbaja Biamila", "id": "5157427", "languages": ["\u82f1\u8bed"], "genres": ["\u771f\u4eba\u79c0"], "title": "\u7f8e\u56fd\u5fcd\u8005\u52c7\u58eb \u7b2c\u4e00\u5b63", "is_released": true, "vendors": [], "actors": [], "episodes_count": 8, "type": "tv", "null_rating_reason": "", "linewatches": [], "info_url": "https://www.douban.com/doubanapp//h5/movie/5157427/desc", "tags": [], "durations": [], "cover": {"description": "", "author": {"loc": {"id": "118283", "name": "\u73e0\u6d77", "uid": "zhuhai"}, "kind": "user", "name": "H", "url": "https://www.douban.com/people/57494473/", "reg_time": "2012-01-03 18:30:50", "uri": "douban://douban.com/user/57494473", "avatar_side_icon_id": "", "avatar": "https://img9.doubanio.com/icon/up57494473-23.jpg", "id": "57494473", "type": "user", "avatar_side_icon": "", "uid": "ZHsee"}, "url": "https://movie.douban.com/photos/photo/2263148962/", "image": {"large": {"url": "https://img9.doubanio.com/view/photo/l/public/p2263148962.webp", "width": 850, "height": 1138, "size": 0}, "raw": null, "small": {"url": "https://img9.doubanio.com/view/photo/s/public/p2263148962.webp", "width": 448, "height": 600, "size": 0}, "normal": {"url": "https://img9.doubanio.com/view/photo/m/public/p2263148962.webp", "width": 448, "height": 600, "size": 0}, "is_animated": false}, "uri": "douban://douban.com/photo/2263148962", "create_time": "2015-08-17 21:11:14", "position": 0, "owner_uri": "douban://douban.com/tv/5157427", "type": "photo", "id": "2263148962", "sharing_url": "https://www.douban.com/doubanapp/dispatch?uri=/photo/2263148962/"}, "cover_url": "https://img9.doubanio.com/view/photo/m_ratio_poster/public/p2263148962.webp", "restrictive_icon_url": "", "header_bg_color": "7f1c15", "honor_infos": [], "sharing_url": "https://movie.douban.com/subject/5157427/", "subject_collections": [], "countries": ["\u7f8e\u56fd"], "url": "https://movie.douban.com/subject/5157427/", "release_date": null, "original_title": "American Ninja Warrior Season 1", "uri": "douban://douban.com/tv/5157427", "episodes_info": "", "subtype": "tv", "directors": [], "is_show": true, "in_blacklist": false, "pre_release_desc": "", "video": null, "aka": [], "is_restrictive": false, "trailer": null, "vendor_icons": [], "extra": {"douban_id": "5157427", "imdb_id": "tt1587934", "backdrops": ["https://www.themoviedb.org/t/p/original/sV6MvkGre3cslV3hEcdQVCb8wsu.jpg"]}}
