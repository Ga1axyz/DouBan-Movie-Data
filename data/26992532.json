New cast members are also welcomed; Nigel Planer (Episodes, Comic Strip Presents, The Young Ones), Keith Allen (Eddie The Eagle, My Mad Fat Diary), Sophia Brown (Beauty & The Beast, Clique, Disobedience), Peter Sullivan (Cuffs, Critical, The Borgias), Jason Hughes (Three Girls, Midsomer Murders), Victoria Smurfit (Once Upon A Time, Trial & Retribution, The Beach), Yolanda Kettle (The Crown, Love Nina), Josh Herdman (Harry Potter) and Harriet Cains (Line of Duty, Safe House).\n\nAnna Friel commented: \u201cI\u2019m thrilled to be reprising the role of Marcella and want to thank ITV for recommissioning this powerful London based noir drama. The reaction from everyone has been amazing, although the real question I keep being asked is whether the green parka will be making an appearance in season 2 as well?\u201d\n\nThe eight-part series is once again set in contemporary London and the new series unfolds in the unique style of Rosenfeldt\u2019s Nordic style.  Interweaving storylines and characters from all different walks of life and backgrounds will lead the audiences on a complex and emotional journey and keep them guessing until the very end.\n\nThe story begins with the discovery of a body inside a wall.  The body is surrounded by toys and soft animals and a school blazer; a devastated Marcella soon works out that the body is that of schoolboy Leo Priestley, who was abducted a few years beforehand and a friend of Marcella\u2019s son, Edward.\n\nA task-force is quickly pulled together by newly promoted DCI, Tim and we are introduced to a new member of the team, LeAnn.  In one of the first meetings, she stands up for Marcella \u2013 something that she is not used to within the workplace.\n\nAs the investigation progresses, we\u2019re introduced to a number of new characters \u2013 an old pop star Reg and his manager and friend Alan; edgy businessman Vince Whitman and his charity boss wife Maya; a previously convicted criminal Phil Dawkins; brother and sister Gail and Eric; and Becky, the new fianc\u00e9e of Marcella\u2019s ex-husband.\n\nWhilst the storylines entwine, Marcella is still battling with her ongoing sporadic fugue states which she struggles to come to terms with and is getting increasingly worried about the effects it is having on her and her family around her.\n\nThe first series of Marcella won many fans, achieved rave reviews and sent social media into meltdown when it aired on ITV in 2016. The launch episode was the series best performer with 8 million viewers and a 29% share of viewing. The series average of 6.8 million viewers (25% share) firmly placed Marcella as one of ITV\u2019s top rated dramas last year.\n\nMarcella has been re-commissioned by Polly Hill, Head of Drama and the production will be overseen for ITV by Senior Commissioner Victoria Fea.\nMarcella will be executive produced by Rosenfeldt, Nicola Larder and Buccaneer Media\u2019s founder Tony Wood who created the joint venture production company in partnership with global entertainment company, Cineflix Media.  Annie Harrison Baxter (In The Flesh, The Secret of Crickley Hall, Wild at Heart) is producing the series and Chris Ballantyne (Broadchurch, Born To Kill, The Level) is co-producing. The first three episodes will be directed by Charles Martin (Stonemouth, The Returned, Skins).", "vendor_icons": [], "year": "2018", "card_subtitle": "2018 / \u82f1\u56fd / \u5267\u60c5 /
