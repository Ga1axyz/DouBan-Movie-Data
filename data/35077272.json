Laszlo is happy that they're fine, but Nadia isn't so sure. She figures that Guillermo is Nandor's responsibility, but he points out that Guillermo did it to save them. Colin doesn't care, and Nadia and the Doll insist that they have to kill Guillermo. Nandor reminds them that they're still in danger, and the Council will send more assassins and only Guillermo can protect them.\nNandor figures that they should slumber on it. Guillermo's bell rings from the basement, and they go down to check on Guillermo. It's been a month since they imprisoned him and haven't decided Guillermo's fate, and they go to Guillermo's cell. Guillermo says that his bathroom bucket is empty. Colin offers to empty it so he can see if Guillermo is sending out secret messages.\nNadia throws raw chicken at Guillermo so he can eat, and Guillermo says that he wouldn't kill them. He reminds that he saved their lives, and he asks if they've just procrastinating without him. Colin uses a cattle prod and shocks himself, and Guillermo yells that he just wants to protect them\nOnce the vampires leave, Guillermo talks to the camera crew and admits that there's good wifi in the basement. He shows them around his cell, and figures the vampires can't do anything without him. He shows that he can get out, and explains that he's been sneaking out while his captors slumber. Guillermo goes upstairs and keeps the house functioning, and the vampires don't notice because they think it happens automatically. Guillermo then goes to a diner to eat, and admits that he's co-dependent.\nGuillermo returns to his cell before everyone wakes up, and listens as the vampires discuss his fate. When they hear him move, Guillermo returns to his cell and locks himself up. Nandor comes down and asks how his familiar is holding out, and admits that it's likely they'll kill Guillermo.\nThe familiar says that he's a soldier and lives by the code of the warrior. Nandor agrees and brings more raw chicken for Guillermo. The vampire then goes, turning the lights on.\nGuillermo has put up security camera to keep an eye on the vampires, and sees bats circling the house. Colin reports that Guillermo isn't sending out secret messages but will continue to check Guillermo's bucket.\nA vampire enters the room as mist. Guillermo runs in and kills it. The female vampire, the Guide, survives, and says that she isn't there to kill anyone. She congratulates Guillermo on being a vampire-hunter, and says that they hadn't heard from them but sent 87 ravens as messengers. They also tried to use the telephone, but it's Guillermo's job to answer the phone and he was locked up.\nThe Guide says that the Supreme Worldwide Vampiric Council has sent her to show them a VCR with their message. After they chain up Guillermo, the Guide plays the tape. The Head of the Council applauds them for eliminating 70% of the most powerful vampires in the Tri-State area. The Head reminds them that the law is that vampires do not kill vampires. The Council figures the four vampires know how to get things done, so they've been appointed the leaders of the Eastern Seaboard Vampiric Council. The Council will be monitoring them.\nThe Guide tells the vampire that she has assisted every Council since 1769, and she's honored to assist them. The next night, she'll take them to the Council building.\nColin brings Guillermo to them, and Nandor says that their final decision about Guillermo is that they won't kill him for now. They've decided to make Guillermo a fully-fledged member of the team, but not a vampire. Instead they're going to make him a vampires' bodyguard. Guillermo takes it rather than die, and the vampires accept Guillermo's acceptance.\nBefore the vampires remove the chains from Guillermo, they use four-way hypnosis on him and Laszlo warns that the odds of Guillermo being mentally stable afterward are slim. Guillermo agrees, and they try to hypnotize him.\nGuillermo tells the film crew that after years of the vampires hypnotizing him, he's immune to vampiric hypnosis. He just lets them think they can hypnotize him.\nThe vampires hypnotize Guillermo to never harm them, and he plays along when he comes out of his \"trance\".\nThe next night, the Guide takes the group to the local Council building and shows them around. Wraith Dancers come in and give the vampires their Council Robes, and asks which one will assume the Master's Throne. The Guide explains that only one of them can be Supreme Leader. Everybody but Laszlo argues who should be the Supreme Leader.by:www.tuikan.cc", "vendor_icons": [], "year": "2021", "card_subtitle": "2021 / \u7f8e\u56fd / \u559c\u5267 \u5947\u5e7b \u6050\u6016 /
