Married in real life, Butler and Hope will also star in the production.\nThe six-part series centres on the trials and tribulations of Frances O'Brien, a devout Catholic and head librarian. Her life unravels when she is forced to employ her ex-best friend, Christine Grimwood - now a drug dealer - as the children's librarian. Frances must do all she can to contain her menacing past and concentrate on the biggest event of the library calendar - Book Week.\nThe Librarians will also star Roz Hammond (The Micallef Programme, Welcher & Welcher), Bob Franklin (BoyTown, The Extra, The Craic), Kim Gyngell (The Comedy Company, Love and Other Catastrophes), Kate Kendall (Stingers), Heidi Arena (Thank God You're Here, Blue Heelers), Stephen Ballantyne (Corpse Bride) and newcomers Josh Lawson (BoyTown, Blue Heelers) and Keith Brockett.\nButler and Hope joined forces in 2004 to write and produce 13 short films called Stories from the Golf for SBS. Butler, who will play the lead character Frances, has starred in feature films including BoyTown and Crackerjack, as well as numerous television series. Most recently she teamed with Mick Molloy on the Triple M's successful ToughLove program.\n\"We are thrilled to be making The Librarians. With 25,000 books on set we have fabricated the perfect excuse to extend our summer reading, added to which, the children's library is very handy for cheap childcare, \" said Robyn.\nHope, who will direct all six episodes, is a seasoned performer with feature films such as BoyTown and many television roles including Stupid Stupid Man, Crashburn and TheMicallef rogramme to his credit.\nABC TV's Executive Producer for Drama Miranda Dear added: \"It's great to be working with such a dynamic comic team. With this series they bring their acute eye for social satire to bear on the world of the library in the most surprising ways. Borrowing a book may never seem as safe again.\"", "webisode_count": 0, "year": "2009", "card_subtitle": "2009 / \u6fb3\u5927\u5229\u4e9a / \u559c\u5267 / Robyn Butler Rosalind Hammond", "id": "3993760", "languages": ["\u82f1\u8bed"], "genres": ["\u559c\u5267"], "review_count": 0, "title": "\u56fe\u4e66\u7ba1\u7406\u5458  \u7b2c\u4e8c\u5b63", "is_released": true, "vendors": [], "actors": [{"name": "Robyn Butler"}, {"name": "Rosalind Hammond"}, {"name": "Heidi Arena"}], "episodes_count": 6, "type": "tv", "null_rating_reason": "\u6682\u65e0\u8bc4\u5206", "linewatches": [], "info_url": "https://www.douban.com/doubanapp//h5/movie/3993760/desc", "tags": [], "durations": ["30\u5206\u949f"], "cover": {"description": "", "author": {"loc": {"id": "108288", "name": "\u5317\u4eac", "uid": "beijing"}, "kind": "user", "name": "LoVe", "url": "https://www.douban.com/people/3467163/", "reg_time": "2009-01-07 22:30:40", "uri": "douban://douban.com/user/3467163", "avatar_side_icon_id": "", "avatar": "https://img9.doubanio.com/icon/up3467163-335.jpg", "id": "3467163", "type": "user", "avatar_side_icon": "", "uid": "Veronicam"}, "url": "https://movie.douban.com/photos/photo/1528455243/", "image": {"large": {"url": "https://qnmob3.doubanio.com/view/photo/large/public/p1528455243.jpg?imageView2/2/q/80/w/600/h/3000/format/webp", "width": 453, "height": 600, "size": 0}, "raw": null, "small": {"url": "https://img9.doubanio.com/view/photo/s/public/p1528455243.webp", "width": 453, "height": 600, "size": 0}, "normal": {"url": "https://img9.doubanio.com/view/photo/m/public/p1528455243.webp", "width": 453, "height": 600, "size": 0}, "is_animated": false}, "uri": "douban://douban.com/photo/1528455243", "create_time": "2012-04-30 00:26:54", "position": 0, "owner_uri": "douban://douban.com/tv/3993760", "type": "photo", "id": "1528455243", "sharing_url": "https://www.douban.com/doubanapp/dispatch?uri=/photo/1528455243/"}, "cover_url": "https://img9.doubanio.com/view/photo/m_ratio_poster/public/p1528455243.webp", "restrictive_icon_url": "", "header_bg_color": "7f7672", "is_douban_intro": false, "ticket_vendor_icons": ["https://img9.doubanio.com/view/dale-online/dale_ad/public/0589a62f2f2d7c2.jpg"], "honor_infos": [], "sharing_url": "https://movie.douban.com/subject/3993760/", "subject_collections": [], "countries": ["\u6fb3\u5927\u5229\u4e9a"], "url": "https://movie.douban.com/subject/3993760/", "release_date": null, "original_title": "The Librarians Season 2", "uri": "douban://douban.com/tv/3993760", "episodes_info": "", "subtype": "tv", "directors": [], "is_show": false, "in_blacklist": false, "pre_release_desc": "", "video": null, "aka": [], "is_restrictive": false, "trailer": null, "vendor_icons": [], "scrap_count": 1}
