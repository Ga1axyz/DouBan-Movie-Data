L\u00edvia and Felipe are of distinct social classes: She is a humble, obliged young lady that lives in the city's convent while Felipe is a noble Earl, nephew-grandson of the powerful Countess Vit\u00f3ria. He is about to walk down the aisle with the beautiful Melissa. L\u00edvia and Felipe fall passionately in love at first sight. To live this passion seems impossible. Beyond the commitment of the Earl, L\u00edvia discovers that she is granddaughter of a Countess, a greatest enemy to her mother, who provoked her separation to Bernardo, the only son to the nobleman. Vit\u00f3ria does not accept the love that its heir felt for the artist mambembe, until it decides to live with the loved one and to open hand of all its wealth. Despaired with the attitude of her son, the Countess sends a letter to Em\u00edlia saying that she is willing to accept her as a daughter-in-law. Bernardo distrusts of the good intentions of her mother and goes to find Em\u00edlia by himself. A great tragedy occur's on the way, and Bernardo dies. The first phase ends with Felipe and L\u00edvia drowning making love oaths.\nSecond phase: Belarrosa\n150 years later, all the people of Campobello, now Belarrosa, will have a second chance to redeem the errors of the past. Felipe Santar\u00e9m, humble owner of a Vin\u00edcola Campobello, and L\u00edvia Beraldini, a cultured, rich and educated young woman, will have a new possibility to live their love. L\u00edvia is daughter to Em\u00edlia, with whom they do not share a good relationship. She is also engaged to Pedro, a possessive and jealousy man. Felipe is already married to Melissa and they are parents to Alex. Melissa is a dedicated wife and left her dreams aside for Felipe despite the sorrow she caused her mother, Dorot\u00e9ia. She will disclose her true colours when she discovers the love between L\u00edvia and Felipe.\nThe new phase also shows the conflicts of Em\u00edlia with her mother, Vit\u00f3ria Ventura. While a child, Em\u00edlia lived in a small town in South of Italy with her mother and father, Alberto Navona. In her seventh birthday, she was abandoned by her mother and this left her traumatized. With regrets, Vit\u00f3ria comes back to ask for forgiveness, but her father (Alberto) fakes his death to avenge the fact that his wife ran away with another man. Now rich and powerful, Em\u00edlia is owner to the Beraldini House - a company that imports wines hosted in Rio de Janeiro. On the other hand, Vit\u00f3ria is through a financial crisis thus decides to put her house in Belarrosa and the Vin\u00edcola Ventura on sale in order to pay her debts. For vengeance, Em\u00edlia buys all her mother's properties without Vit\u00f3ria's knowledge that the purchaser is her own daughter and that she plans to disinherit her from the patrimony.",
