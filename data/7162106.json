Today it is practised by over 350 million people worldwide, with numbers continuing to grow year on year.\nIn an attempt to gain a better understanding of the different beliefs and practices that form the core of the Buddhist philosophy and investigate how Buddhism started and where it travelled to, Hughes visits some of the most spectacular monuments built by Buddhists across the globe.\nHer journey begins at the Mahabodhi Temple in India, where Buddhism was born; here Hughes examines the foundations of the belief system - the three jewels.\nAt Nepal's Boudhanath Stupa, she looks deeper into the concept of dharma - the teaching of Buddha, and at the Temple of the Tooth in Sri Lanka, Bettany explores karma, the idea that our intentional acts will be mirrored in the future.\nAt Wat Pho Temple in Thailand, Hughes explores samsara, the endless cycle of birth and death that Buddhists seek to end by achieving enlightenment, before travelling to Angkor Wat in Cambodia to learn more about the practice of meditation.\nIn Hong Kong, Hughes visits the Giant Buddha and looks more closely at Zen, before arriving at the final wonder, the Hsi Lai temple in Los Angeles, to discover more about the ultimate goal for all Buddhists - nirvana.", "webisode_count": 0, "year": "2011", "card_subtitle": "2011 / \u82f1\u56fd / \u7eaa\u5f55\u7247 / Faris Kermani", "id": "7162106", "languages": [], "genres": ["\u7eaa\u5f55\u7247"], "review_count": 4, "title": "\u4f5b\u6559\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u4e03\u5927\u5947\u89c2", "is_released": true, "vendors": [], "actors": [], "episodes_count": 0, "type": "movie", "null_rating_reason": "", "linewatches": [], "info_url": "https://www.douban.com/doubanapp//h5/movie/7162106/desc", "tags": [], "durations": ["74\u5206\u949f"], "cover": {"description": "", "author": {"loc": {"id": "128196", "name": "Mumbai", "uid": "mumbai"}, "kind": "user", "name": "yihan1010", "url": "https://www.douban.com/people/1609757/", "reg_time": "2007-06-13 07:17:16", "uri": "douban://douban.com/user/1609757", "avatar_side_icon_id": "", "avatar": "https://img9.doubanio.com/icon/up1609757-19.jpg", "id": "1609757", "type": "user", "avatar_side_icon": "", "uid": "1609757"}, "url": "https://movie.douban.com/photos/photo/2428110013/", "image": {"large": {"url": "https://img9.doubanio.com/view/photo/l/public/p2428110013.webp", "width": 855, "height": 1000, "size": 0}, "raw": null, "small": {"url": "https://img9.doubanio.com/view/photo/s/public/p2428110013.webp", "width": 513, "height": 600, "size": 0}, "normal": {"url": "https://img9.doubanio.com/view/photo/m/public/p2428110013.webp", "width": 513, "height": 600, "size": 0}, "is_animated": false}, "uri": "douban://douban.com/photo/2428110013", "create_time": "2017-02-12 22:02:17", "position": 0, "owner_uri": "douban://douban.com/movie/7162106", "type": "photo", "id": "2428110013", "sharing_url": "https://www.douban.com/doubanapp/dispatch?uri=/photo/2428110013/"}, "cover_url": "https://img9.doubanio.com/view/photo/m_ratio_poster/public/p2428110013.webp", "restrictive_icon_url": "", "header_bg_color": "7f5657", "is_douban_intro": false, "ticket_vendor_icons": ["https://img9.doubanio.com/view/dale-online/dale_ad/public/0589a62f2f2d7c2.jpg"], "honor_infos": [], "sharing_url": "https://movie.douban.com/subject/7162106/", "subject_collections": [], "countries": ["\u82f1\u56fd"], "url": "https://movie.douban.com/subject/7162106/", "release_date": null, "original_title": "Seven Wonders of the Buddhist World", "uri": "douban://douban.com/movie/7162106", "episodes_info": "", "subtype": "movie", "directors": [], "is_show": false, "in_blacklist": false, "pre_release_desc": "", "video": null, "aka": ["BBC.\u4f5b\u6559\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u4e03\u5927\u5947\u89c2"], "is_restrictive": false, "trailer": null, "vendor_icons": [], "extra": {"douban_id": "7162106", "imdb_id": "tt2004343", "backdrops": ["https://www.themoviedb.org/t/p/original/iJrWfmqDDk7Tnic6IN9TaSyeYHO.jpg"]}, "scrap_count": 1}
