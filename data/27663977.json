Sophie will explore how laughter provides a link to our animal past, how our voice box has changed the shape of our faces and why we sound the way we do.\nIn Lecture Two Sophie will explore the hidden code of communication, the more secret and sometimes more sinister side of human interaction \u2013 everything we say without opening our mouths \u2013 from contagious behaviours to the emotional clues in smell, and whether information wired directly into our brains is really a future we want.\nAnd in Lecture Three, Sophie will examine one of the biggest puzzles in science \u2013 how and when humans first evolved language \u2013 revealing the huge amount of raw brain power and sensory skill needed to understand even a simple sentence and how we convey as much meaning through our tone, pace and pitch of voice as we say with our words.\nAlong the way we\u2019ll feature a modern-day return to classic television moments from past Lectures such as Sir David Attenborough\u2019s \u2018The Language of Animals\u2019 from 1973, and may even attempt a world record.", "webisode_count": 0, "year": "2017", "card_subtitle": "2017 / \u82f1\u56fd / David Coleman / Sophie Scott", "id": "27663977", "languages": ["\u82f1\u8bed"], "genres": [], "title": "\u82f1\u56fd\u7687\u5bb6\u79d1\u5b66\u9662\u5723\u8bde\u8bb2\u5ea7 2017: \u751f\u547d\u7684\u8bed\u8a00", "is_released": true, "vendors": [], "actors": [], "episodes_count": 3, "type": "tv", "null_rating_reason": "\u6682\u65e0\u8bc4\u5206", "linewatches": [], "info_url": "https://www.douban.com/doubanapp//h5/movie/27663977/desc", "tags": [], "durations": ["59\u5206\u949f"], "cover": {"description": "", "author": {"loc": {"id": "108296", "name": "\u4e0a\u6d77", "uid": "shanghai"}, "kind": "user", "name": "\u5b87\u5b99\u771f\u7406\u732a\u5927\u80a0", "url": "https://www.douban.com/people/1727133/", "reg_time": "2007-07-31 16:57:07", "uri": "douban://douban.com/user/1727133", "avatar_side_icon_id": "119", "avatar": "https://img9.doubanio.com/icon/up1727133-201.jpg", "id": "1727133", "type": "user", "avatar_side_icon": "https://img9.doubanio.com/view/files/raw/file-1663567932.png", "uid": "overload"}, "url": "https://movie.douban.com/photos/photo/2510411229/", "image": {"large": {"url": "https://img9.doubanio.com/view/photo/l/public/p2510411229.webp", "width": 720, "height": 960, "size": 0}, "raw": null, "small": {"url": "https://img9.doubanio.com/view/photo/s/public/p2510411229.webp", "width": 450, "height": 600, "size": 0}, "normal": {"url": "https://img9.doubanio.com/view/photo/m/public/p2510411229.webp", "width": 450, "height": 600, "size": 0}, "is_animated": false}, "uri": "douban://douban.com/photo/2510411229", "create_time": "2018-01-12 15:46:57", "position": 0, "owner_uri": "douban://douban.com/tv/27663977", "type": "photo", "id": "2510411229", "sharing_url": "https://www.douban.com/doubanapp/dispatch?uri=/photo/2510411229/"}, "cover_url": "https://img9.doubanio.com/view/photo/m_ratio_poster/public/p2510411229.webp", "restrictive_icon_url": "", "header_bg_color": "4c3737", "honor_infos": [], "sharing_url": "https://movie.douban.com/subject/27663977/", "subject_collections": [], "countries": ["\u82f1\u56fd"], "url": "https://movie.douban.com/subject/27663977/", "release_date": null, "original_title": "The Royal Institution Christmas Lectures 2017: The Language of Life", "uri": "douban://douban.com/tv/27663977", "episodes_info": "", "subtype": "tv", "directors": [], "is_show": false, "in_blacklist": false, "pre_release_desc": "", "video": null, "aka": [], "is_restrictive": false, "trailer": null, "vendor_icons": [], "f_tags": ["2017", "\u82f1\u56fd", "David", "Coleman", "Sophie", "Scott"]}
