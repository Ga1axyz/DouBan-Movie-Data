Billy\u2019s sexual identity is a complicated one for the era and he runs into prejudice in his hometown Auckland. Because of these difficulties he decides to go somewhere where he is unknown; where he can re-invent himself. He decides to take on a job at large farm. What he discovers on the farm is the very thing he has tried to leave behind but to an even greater extent. The tension and repression is heightened further by the isolation of 1960\u2019s rural New Zealand. He discovers that he is not the only one fighting his desires and hiding his demons.", "webisode_count": 0, "year": "2017", "card_subtitle": "2017 / \u65b0\u897f\u5170 / \u5267\u60c5 \u540c\u6027 / Alastair Riddell / Kieran Foster Luke Thompson", "id": "26615214", "languages": ["\u82f1\u8bed"], "genres": ["\u5267\u60c5", "\u540c\u6027"], "review_count": 0, "title": "\u4f0a\u7538\u56ed\u4ee5\u897f", "is_released": true, "vendors": [], "actors": [], "episodes_count": 0, "type": "movie", "null_rating_reason": "", "linewatches": [], "info_url": "https://www.douban.com/doubanapp//h5/movie/26615214/desc", "tags": [], "durations": ["105\u5206\u949f"], "cover": {"description": "", "author": {"loc": null, "kind": "user", "name": "\u540c\u5fd7\u4ea6\u51e1\u4eba\u4e2d\u6587\u7ad9", "url": "https://www.douban.com/people/3540441/", "reg_time": "2009-01-25 10:05:26", "uri": "douban://douban.com/user/3540441", "avatar_side_icon_id": "", "avatar": "https://img9.doubanio.com/icon/up3540441-63.jpg", "id": "3540441", "type": "user", "avatar_side_icon": "", "uid": "3540441"}, "url": "https://movie.douban.com/photos/photo/2423162596/", "image": {"large": {"url": "https://img9.doubanio.com/view/photo/l/public/p2423162596.webp", "width": 960, "height": 1358, "size": 0}, "raw": null, "small": {"url": "https://img9.doubanio.com/view/photo/s/public/p2423162596.webp", "width": 424, "height": 600, "size": 0}, "normal": {"url": "https://img9.doubanio.com/view/photo/m/public/p2423162596.webp", "width": 424, "height": 600, "size": 0}, "is_animated": false}, "uri": "douban://douban.com/photo/2423162596", "create_time": "2017-02-03 16:48:58", "position": 0, "owner_uri": "douban://douban.com/movie/26615214", "type": "photo", "id": "2423162596", "sharing_url": "https://www.douban.com/doubanapp/dispatch?uri=/photo/2423162596/"}, "cover_url": "https://img9.doubanio.com/view/photo/m_ratio_poster/public/p2423162596.webp", "restrictive_icon_url": "", "header_bg_color": "7f6445", "is_douban_intro": false, "ticket_vendor_icons": ["https://img9.doubanio.com/view/dale-online/dale_ad/public/0589a62f2f2d7c2.jpg"], "honor_infos": [], "sharing_url": "https://movie.douban.com/subject/26615214/", "subject_collections": [], "countries": ["\u65b0\u897f\u5170"], "url": "https://movie.douban.com/subject/26615214/", "release_date": null, "original_title": "West of Eden", "uri": "douban://douban.com/movie/26615214", "episodes_info": "", "subtype": "movie", "directors": [], "is_show": false, "in_blacklist": false, "pre_release_desc": "", "video": null, "aka": ["\u4f0a\u7538\u4e4b\u897f"], "is_restrictive": false, "trailer": null, "vendor_icons": [], "extra": {"douban_id": "26615214", "imdb_id": "tt3859872", "backdrops": ["https://www.themoviedb.org/t/p/original/sBQw0T2KIaYiwlwNsksIb26j8IN.jpg"]}, "scrap_count": 1}
