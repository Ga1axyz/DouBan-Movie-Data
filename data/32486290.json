It's a land of diverse beauty, that delights and surprises. The series both entertains and deepens our understanding of how the natural world is made up of not just unique species, but distinct individuals, whose lives are far from predictable. Using the latest camera technology we capture animal populations only recently discovered and behaviours not associated with species we thought we knew well. We meet animal characters so enigmatic, most Australians are unaware they share not just their island continent - but their own suburban backyards. We reveal the challenges these animals must navigate in a land of extremes, and extreme human-induced change. To do this, we fill the screen with colour, dance, acrobatics, music, mating and murder - all performed by the animals which make Australia a truly magical land.", "webisode_count": 0, "year": "2019", "card_subtitle": "2019 / \u82f1\u56fd / \u7d00\u9304\u7247 Documentary / Barry Humphries", "id": "32486290", "languages": ["\u82f1\u8bed"], "genres": ["\u7d00\u9304\u7247 Documentary"], "review_count": 4, "title": "\u7eff\u91ce\u4ed9\u6fb3", "is_released": true, "vendors": [], "actors": [], "episodes_count": 3, "type": "tv", "null_rating_reason": "", "linewatches": [], "info_url": "https://www.douban.com/doubanapp//h5/movie/32486290/desc", "tags": [], "durations": ["1\u5c0f\u65f6"], "cover": {"description": "", "author": {"loc": {"id": "118163", "name": "\u82cf\u5dde", "uid": "suzhou"}, "kind": "user", "name": "killyoumygod", "url": "https://www.douban.com/people/51969853/", "reg_time": "2011-05-30 05:11:20", "uri": "douban://douban.com/user/51969853", "avatar_side_icon_id": "", "avatar": "https://img9.doubanio.com/icon/up51969853-4.jpg", "id": "51969853", "type": "user", "avatar_side_icon": "", "uid": "killyoumygod"}, "url": "https://movie.douban.com/photos/photo/2552339823/", "image": {"large": {"url": "https://img9.doubanio.com/view/photo/l/public/p2552339823.webp", "width": 814, "height": 999, "size": 0}, "raw": null, "small": {"url": "https://img9.doubanio.com/view/photo/s/public/p2552339823.webp", "width": 488, "height": 600, "size": 0}, "normal": {"url": "https://img9.doubanio.com/view/photo/m/public/p2552339823.webp", "width": 488, "height": 600, "size": 0}, "is_animated": false}, "uri": "douban://douban.com/photo/2552339823", "create_time": "2019-04-01 10:35:52", "position": 1, "owner_uri": "douban://douban.com/tv/32486290", "type": "photo", "id": "2552339823", "sharing_url": "https://www.douban.com/doubanapp/dispatch?uri=/photo/2552339823/"}, "cover_url": "https://img9.doubanio.com/view/photo/m_ratio_poster/public/p2552339823.webp", "restrictive_icon_url": "", "header_bg_color": "567f77", "is_douban_intro": false, "ticket_vendor_icons": ["https://img9.doubanio.com/view/dale-online/dale_ad/public/0589a62f2f2d7c2.jpg"], "honor_infos": [], "sharing_url": "https://movie.douban.com/subject/32486290/", "subject_collections": [], "countries": ["\u82f1\u56fd"], "url": "https://movie.douban.com/subject/32486290/", "release_date": null, "original_title": "Australia: Earth's Magical Kingdom", "uri": "douban://douban.com/tv/32486290", "episodes_info": "", "subtype": "tv", "directors": [], "is_show": false, "in_blacklist": false, "pre_release_desc": "", "video": null, "aka": ["Magical Land of Oz", "\u4ed9\u5883\u4e4b\u5730"], "is_restrictive": false, "trailer": null, "vendor_icons": [], "extra": {"douban_id": "32486290", "imdb_id": "tt9833368", "backdrops": ["https://www.themoviedb.org/t/p/original/bDcxXvg8AyQyAp58zrsrQ8HfFJA.jpg"]}, "scrap_count": 1}
