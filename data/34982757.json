Are we alone? Chapter 1 of this experience takes you to alien worlds and distant places in time and space, in search of where alien life might be hiding and what our place is within the history of life.  After generations of wondering, the truth is finally within our reach.  New research and technologies have brought us closer than ever to an answer - only a few decades in the eyes of some NASA scientists.\nThe search has led to new discoveries that will blow your mind wide open and give a profound new perspective on human life. The deeper we look, the deeper we see into nature's imagination, and the more we learn about ourselves.  I hope stewing on these thoughts tickles your brain as deeply as it does mine.\nLIFE BEYOND 2: The Museum of Alien Life\uff082020\uff09\nWhat if there was a museum that contained every type of life form in the universe?  This experience takes you on a tour through the possible forms alien life might take, from the eerily familiar to the utterly exotic, ranging from the inside of the Earth to the most hostile corners of the universe.\nNew research is upending our idea of life and where it could be hiding: not just on Earth-like planets, where beings could mimic what our planet has produced, but in far flung places like the hearts of dead stars and the rings of gas giant planets. Nowhere in the universe is off limits.\nOnly when we know what else is out there will we truly know ourselves. This thought experiment will give us a glimpse into what could be out there, how we might find it, and just how far nature\u2019s imagination might stretch.\nLIFE BEYOND 3: In Search of Giants.\uff082021\uff09\nFor 60 years now, we have probed the skies for signs of alien intelligence, longing for connection -- to no avail. But new ideas and technologies are beginning to change the game.\nProudly presenting the third chapter in the Life Beyond trilogy: In Search of Giants.\nIn this journey, we will see how far we\u2019ve come in the search for intelligent life, how they might be communicating, just how advanced they might be, and what it would mean if we really did make contact.\nIt might take thousands of years to make a discovery.  But as long as the mystery endures, the search for giants will continue.  It's in our blood to want to know.", "vendor_icons": [], "year": "2019", "card_subtitle": "2019 / \u7f8e\u56fd / \u79d1\u5e7b \u7eaa\u5f55\u7247 / John D.
