Every year, Americans alone consume on average 11.7 pounds of it. The worldwide consumption increases every year at a rate of 4%. But chocolate, as it turns out, was never meant to be candy. For the ancient Mayans and Aztecs, it was a powerful food to be worshipped. A single drink pressed from cacao beans could sustain a warrior for days in the heat of battle. The ancients even used these sacred beans as currency. When science took it upon itself to give the cacao tree a name, it chose \u201cTheobrama Cacao\u201d -- Food of the Gods. The film \"Semisweet: Life in Chocolate\" travels to four vastly different places around the globe to follow the unique journey of characters whose lives have been intrinsically transformed by chocolate. It\u2019s a story told through the personal journeys and lives of extraordinary characters. And, although their paths have never directly crossed, their lives are interwoven through their very unique and personal relationship with chocolate.", "webisode_count": 0, "year": "2012", "card_subtitle": "2012 / \u52a0\u62ff\u5927 / \u7eaa\u5f55\u7247 / Michael Allcock Lalita Krishna", "id": "24705104", "languages": ["\u82f1\u8bed"], "genres": ["\u7eaa\u5f55\u7247"], "title": "\u82e6\u751c\u53c2\u534a\uff1a\u5de7\u514b\u529b\u4eba\u751f", "is_released": true, "vendors": [], "actors": [], "episodes_count": 0, "type": "movie", "null_rating_reason": "", "linewatches": [], "info_url": "https://www.douban.com/doubanapp//h5/movie/24705104/desc", "tags": [], "durations": ["56\u5206\u949f"], "cover": {"description": "", "author": {"loc": {"id": "118281", "name": "\u5e7f\u5dde", "uid": "guangzhou"}, "kind": "user", "name": "\u8ff7\u3002", "url": "https://www.douban.com/people/2210732/", "reg_time": "2008-02-01 22:33:12", "uri": "douban://douban.com/user/2210732", "avatar_side_icon_id": "", "avatar": "https://img9.doubanio.com/icon/u2210732-2.jpg", "id": "2210732", "type": "user", "avatar_side_icon": "", "uid": "privatelie"}, "url": "https://movie.douban.com/photos/photo/1996229344/", "image": {"large": {"url": "https://img9.doubanio.com/view/photo/l/public/p1996229344.webp", "width": 600, "height": 800, "size": 0}, "raw": null, "small": {"url": "https://img9.doubanio.com/view/photo/s/public/p1996229344.webp", "width": 450, "height": 600, "size": 0}, "is_animated": false, "normal": {"url": "https://img9.doubanio.com/view/photo/m/public/p1996229344.webp", "width": 450, "height": 600, "size": 0}}, "uri": "douban://douban.com/photo/1996229344", "create_time": "2013-06-06 22:24:31", "position": 0, "owner_uri": "douban://douban.com/movie/24705104", "type": "photo", "id": "1996229344", "sharing_url": "https://www.douban.com/doubanapp/dispatch?uri=/photo/1996229344/"}, "cover_url": "https://img9.doubanio.com/view/photo/m_ratio_poster/public/p1996229344.webp", "restrictive_icon_url": "", "header_bg_color": "7f624e", "honor_infos": [], "sharing_url": "https://movie.douban.com/subject/24705104/", "subject_collections": [], "countries": ["\u52a0\u62ff\u5927"], "url": "https://movie.douban.com/subject/24705104/", "release_date": null, "original_title": "Semisweet: Life in Chocolate", "uri": "douban://douban.com/movie/24705104", "episodes_info": "", "subtype": "movie", "directors": [{"name": "\u8fc8\u514b\u5c14\u00b7\u963f\u5c14\u8003\u514b", "roles": ["\u7f16\u5267", "\u5bfc\u6f14"], "title": "\u8fc8\u514b\u5c14\u00b7\u963f\u5c14\u8003\u514b\uff08\u540c\u540d\uff09None\u5f71\u89c6\u6f14\u5458", "url": "https://movie.douban.com/celebrity/1329140/", "uri": "douban://douban.com/celebrity/1329140?subject_id=27541689", "avatar": {"large": "https://img9.doubanio.com/f/movie/63acc16ca6309ef191f0378faf793d1096a3e606/pics/movie/celebrity-default-large.png", "normal": "https://img9.doubanio.com/f/movie/8dd0c794499fe925ae2ae89ee30cd225750457b4/pics/movie/celebrity-default-medium.png"}, "sharing_url": "https://www.douban.com/doubanapp/dispatch?uri=/celebrity/1329140/", "type": "celebrity", "id": "1329140", "latin_name": "Michael Allcock", "movies": [{"id": "24705104", "title": "\u82e6\u751c\u53c2\u534a\uff1a\u5de7\u514b\u529b\u4eba\u751f", "original_title": "Semisweet: Life in Chocolate", "year": "2012", "is_tv": false, "rating": {"count": 802, "max": 10, "star_count": 3.5, "value": 7.2}, "poster": "https://img9.doubanio.com/view/photo/m_ratio_poster/public/p1996229344.webp"}], "_id": {"$oid": "63299c0ae2750ef0ce8fc5a8"}}], "is_show": false, "in_blacklist": false, "pre_release_desc": "", "video": null, "aka": [], "is_restrictive": false, "trailer": null, "vendor_icons": [], "extra": {"douban_id": "24705104", "imdb_id": "tt2339627", "backdrops": []}}
