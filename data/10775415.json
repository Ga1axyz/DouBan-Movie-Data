Viewers will also see the dark side of this seemingly perfect world; the jealousy, competition and intensity that exist behind the scenes at a professional ballet company. For under the tights and tutus lie warriors, who battle in a gritty world of extreme athleticism, focus and dedication, while hunting for the unattainable...perfection.\n\"Breaking Pointe\" rips back the curtain on the inner workings of elite Salt Lake City Ballet Company, Ballet West. It obliterates the notion that ballet is a dated art form and shatters pre-conceived stereotypes about the men and women who give their lives to the world of ballet. Beneath their perfect exteriors, these dancers have the toughness of linebackers, punishing their bodies to achieve perfection and dancing through injuries and pain.\nLed by Artistic Director Adam Sklute, a former dancer and Associate Director of The Joffrey Ballet, Ballet West and Ballet West II's company of 48 dancers includes: Principal Artist Christiana Bennett, Soloist Ronnie Underwood, Demi-Soloist Allison DeBona, Demi-Soloist Rex Tilton, Beckanne Sisk, Kathleen Martin and Ronald Tilton.\nShot in a rich, cinematic style, \"Breaking Pointe\" pulls the viewer directly into the company, where they will experience the exhausting rehearsals, the stylized glamour of the dancers' life and the vibrant and dynamic main-stage performances.\nIt's every little girl's dream to grow up and become a ballerina, but nobody knows what the world of competitive ballet is really about. No one sees the sacrifice and discipline it takes to look perfect for the audience. Nobody knows that in order to advance and get the best roles, dancers have to navigate the complicated social politics inside the company. And, no one sees, when the curtain goes down, the drama that bleeds into the dancers\u2019 private lives\u2026until now.", "webisode_count": 0, "year": "2012", "card_subtitle": "2012 / \u7f8e\u56fd / \u7eaa\u5f55\u7247 \u821e\u53f0\u827a\u672f / Adam Sklute Christiana Bennett", "id": "10775415", "languages": ["\u82f1\u8bed"], "genres": ["\u7eaa\u5f55\u7247", "\u821e\u53f0\u827a\u672f"], "title": "\u51b3\u6218\u82ad\u857e\u4e4b\u5dc5 \u7b2c\u4e00\u5b63", "is_released": true, "vendors": [], "actors": [], "episodes_count": 6, "type": "tv", "null_rating_reason": "", "linewatches": [], "info_url": "https://www.douban.com/doubanapp//h5/movie/10775415/desc", "tags": [], "durations": ["40\u5206\u949f"], "cover": {"description": "", "author": {"loc": {"id": "118172", "name": "\u676d\u5dde", "uid": "hangzhou"}, "kind": "user", "name": "Nelly\u55b5", "url": "https://www.douban.com/people/1554355/", "reg_time": "2007-05-13 17:33:19", "uri": "douban://douban.com/user/1554355", "avatar_side_icon_id": "", "avatar": "https://img9.doubanio.com/icon/up1554355-39.jpg", "id": "1554355", "type": "user", "avatar_side_icon": "", "uid": "Nellyzhou"}, "url": "https://movie.douban.com/photos/photo/1575490591/", "image": {"large": {"url": "https://qnmob3.doubanio.com/view/photo/large/public/p1575490591.jpg?imageView2/2/q/80/w/600/h/3000/format/webp", "width": 400, "height": 566, "size": 0}, "raw": null, "small": {"url": "https://img9.doubanio.com/view/photo/s/public/p1575490591.webp", "width": 400, "height": 566, "size": 0}, "is_animated": false, "normal": {"url": "https://img9.doubanio.com/view/photo/m/public/p1575490591.webp", "width": 400, "height": 566, "size": 0}}, "uri": "douban://douban.com/photo/1575490591", "create_time": "2012-06-04 13:19:19", "position": 0, "owner_uri": "douban://douban.com/tv/10775415", "type": "photo", "id": "1575490591", "sharing_url": "https://www.douban.com/doubanapp/dispatch?uri=/photo/1575490591/"}, "cover_url": "https://img9.doubanio.com/view/photo/m_ratio_poster/public/p1575490591.webp", "restrictive_icon_url": "", "header_bg_color": "4c3626", "honor_infos": [], "sharing_url": "https://movie.douban.com/subject/10775415/", "subject_collections": [], "countries": ["\u7f8e\u56fd"], "url": "https://movie.douban.com/subject/10775415/", "release_date": null, "original_title": "Breaking Pointe Season 1", "uri": "douban://douban.com/tv/10775415", "episodes_info": "", "subtype": "tv", "directors": [], "is_show": true, "in_blacklist": false, "pre_release_desc": "", "video": null, "aka": ["\u811a\u5c16\u4e0a\u7684\u4e16\u754c", "\u51b3\u6218\u82ad\u857e\u4e4b\u5dc5"], "is_restrictive": false, "trailer": null, "vendor_icons": [], "extra": {"douban_id": "10775415", "imdb_id": "tt2290981", "backdrops": ["https://www.themoviedb.org/t/p/original/2MfilSH9DiTgCWCM08PGwoKP9xl.jpg"]}, "f_tags": ["2012", "\u7f8e\u56fd", "\u7eaa\u5f55\u7247", "\u821e\u53f0\u827a\u672f", "Adam", "Sklute", "Christiana", "Bennett"]}
