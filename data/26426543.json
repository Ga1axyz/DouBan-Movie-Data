Instead you sit alone before a screen.  So what is stopping us from doing what we want, being where we wanna be?\nEach day we wake up in the same room, following the same path to live the same day as yesterday. Yet at one time, each day was a new adventure. Along the way something changed.  Before, our days were timeless, now our days are scheduled. Is this what it means to be grownup, to be free, but are we really free?  Food, water and land, the very elements we need to survive are owned by corporations.\nIf you try to take what earth provides you\u2019ll be locked away, so we obey their rules.\nWe discovered the world through a text book, raised not to make a difference in this world, raised to be no different.  Smart enough to do our job, but not to question why we do it.  So we work and work left with no time to live the life we worked for.\nIf you live in America there is a 41% chance you will get cancer. Heart Disease will kill one out of 3 Americans.\nWe\u2019re told that everything could be solved by throwing money at scientists so that they can discover a pill that makes our problems go away. But the drug companies and cancer societies rely on our suffering to make a profit. We think we running for a cure but really we running away from the cause. Our body is a product of what we consume and the food we eat is designed purely for profit. We fill ourselves with toxic chemicals, the bodies of animals infested with drugs and diseases.\nBut we don\u2019t see this. The small group of corporations that own the media don\u2019t\u2019 want us to. Surrounding us with a fantasy we\u2019re told is reality.\nIt is not too late, we can change it.", "vendor_icons": [], "year": "2015", "card_subtitle": "2015 / \u7f8e\u56fd / \u77ed\u7247 / Spencer Cathcart / Spencer Cathcart", "id": "26426543", "is_restrictive": false, "languages": ["\u82f1\u8bed"], "genres": ["\u77ed\u7247"], "can_interact": true, "review_count": 2, "title": "\u6211\u4eec\u6240\u5904\u7684\u8c0e\u8a00\u4e16\u754c", "is_released": true, "vendors": [], "actors": [{"name": "Spencer Cathcart"}], "episodes_count": 0, "type": "movie", "null_rating_reason": "", "linewatches": [], "info_url": "https://www.douban.com/doubanapp//h5/movie/26426543/desc", "tags": [{"url": "https://www.douban.com/channel/30307625", "uri": "douban://douban.com/channel/30307625", "id": "30307625", "is_channel": true, "name": "\u77ed\u7247"}, {"url": "https://www.douban.com/channel/30307295", "uri": "douban://douban.com/channel/30307295", "id": "30307295", "is_channel": true, "name": "\u7f8e\u56fd"}, {"url": "https://www.douban.com/channel/30307615", "uri": "douban://douban.com/channel/30307615", "id": "30307615", "is_channel": true, "name": "\u793e\u4f1a\u7eaa\u5f55\u7247"}, {"url": "https://www.douban.com/channel/30169652", "uri": "douban://douban.com/channel/30169652", "id": "30169652", "is_channel": true, "name": "\u4eba\u6027"}, {"url": "https://www.douban.com/channel/30307866", "uri": "douban://douban.com/channel/30307866", "id": "30307866", "is_channel": true, "name": "\u707e\u96be"}, {"url": "https://www.douban.com/channel/30307939", "uri": "douban://douban.com/channel/30307939", "id": "30307939", "is_channel": true, "name": "2010s"}], "durations": ["8\u5206\u949f"], "cover": {"description": "", "author": {"loc": {"id": "118281", "name": "\u5e7f\u5dde", "uid": "guangzhou"}, "kind": "user", "name": "NeHe", "url": "https://www.douban.com/people/47819577/", "reg_time": "2010-12-02 20:03:06", "uri": "douban://douban.com/user/47819577", "avatar": "https://img9.doubanio.com/icon/up47819577-18.jpg", "id": "47819577", "type": "user", "avatar_side_icon": "", "uid": "NeHes"}, "url": "https://movie.douban.com/photos/photo/2259138072/", "image": {"large": {"url": "https://img9.doubanio.com/view/photo/l/public/p2259138072.webp", "width": 600, "height": 900, "size": 0}, "raw": null, "small": {"url": "https://img9.doubanio.com/view/photo/s/public/p2259138072.webp", "width": 400, "height": 600, "size": 0}, "is_animated": false, "normal": {"url": "https://img9.doubanio.com/view/photo/m/public/p2259138072.webp", "width": 400, "height": 600, "size": 0}}, "uri": "douban://douban.com/photo/2259138072", "create_time": "2015-07-28 16:59:38", "position": 0, "owner_uri": "douban://douban.com/movie/26426543", "type": "photo", "id": "2259138072", "sharing_url": "https://www.douban.com/doubanapp/dispatch?uri=/photo/2259138072/"}, "cover_url": "https://img9.doubanio.com/view/photo/m_ratio_poster/public/p2259138072.webp", "restrictive_icon_url": "", "header_bg_color": "4c4c4c", "is_douban_intro": false, "honor_infos": [], "sharing_url": "https://movie.douban.com/subject/26426543/", "countries": ["\u7f8e\u56fd"], "url": "https://movie.douban.com/subject/26426543/", "release_date": null, "original_title": "The Lie We Live", "uri": "douban://douban.com/movie/26426543", "episodes_info": "", "subtype": "movie", "directors": [{"name": "Spencer Cathcart"}], "is_show": false, "in_blacklist": false, "pre_release_desc": "", "video": null, "aka": ["\u6211\u4eec\u8eab\u5904\u8c0e\u8a00\u7684\u4e16\u754c"], "webisode_count": 0, "trailer": null, "extra": {"douban_id": "26426543", "imdb_id": "tt4546380", "backdrops": ["https://www.themoviedb.org/t/p/original/hi1ZKx2jM8wsjo5E6fITkLcZksR.jpg"]}, "scrap_count": 1}
