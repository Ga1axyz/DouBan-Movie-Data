From guns to knives to swords to cannons, Will sells, trades, buys, builds and customizes them all. When Will isn't rebuilding a \"bring-back\" rifle from the Vietnam War or re-stringing a bow to hunt swamp gators, he can be found in his Louisiana Bayou shop swapping gossip with his customers that range from housewives to members of the SWAT team. Will, his daughter Stephanie, and the rest of his crew, race to keep up with the demands of their client\u00e8le and turn out top notch weapons. But whether it's having a lunch break shooting contest, going on a nighttime bayou bow fishing trip or field testing a fully automatic M2 .50 caliber machine gun, viewers will catch the Red Jacket team always finding time to have some fun.
