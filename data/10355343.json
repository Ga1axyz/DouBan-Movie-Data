They decide to hangout together one evening in London and find that they are completely drawn to each other even as their future lies on separate continents.\n\n\n\nThe film follows their personal journey and their love story as they meet in London, Paris and New York for a night each over eight years. The film is in three chapters and each chapter will be shot in a manner that mirrors the mental state of Nikhil and Lalitha.. The three bridges on the three rivers - Thames, Seine and Hudson witness the three states of love.\n\n\n\nMusic is integral to the film and takes form according to the moods. The three cities also give a dramatic canvas to create different exciting themes. Pop -Romance in London. Electronic Sufi in Paris. Blues-rap in New York. Blended in with Indian true bollywood style.The dialogues are natural and fresh and you get a sense that you are eavesdropping on these two characters. The film is romantic but not sentimental in the least. Even though there are discussing a lot of meaningful stuff, the film is always underpinned by humour.", "webisode_count": 0, "year": "2012", "card_subtitle": "2012 / \u5370\u5ea6 india / \u7231\u60c5 / Anu Menon / \u963f\u91cc.\u672d\u6cd5 Aditi Rao Hydari", "id": "10355343", "languages": ["\u5370\u5730\u8bed Hindi"], "genres": ["\u7231\u60c5"], "review_count": 0, "title": "\u4f26\u6566 \u5df4\u9ece \u7ebd\u7ea6", "is_released": true, "vendors": [], "actors": [{"name": "\u963f\u91cc.\u672d\u6cd5"}, {"name": "Aditi Rao Hydari"}, {"name": "Chris Cowlin"}, {"name": "Eric Geynes"}, {"name": "Samantha Spurgin"}], "episodes_count": 0, "type": "movie", "null_rating_reason": "", "linewatches": [], "info_url": "https://www.douban.com/doubanapp//h5/movie/10355343/desc", "tags": [], "durations": [], "cover": {"description": "", "author": {"loc": {"id": "108288", "name": "\u5317\u4eac", "uid": "beijing"}, "kind": "user", "name": "\u542f\u621f", "url": "https://www.douban.com/people/53802357/", "reg_time": "2011-08-15 11:52:33", "uri": "douban://douban.com/user/53802357", "avatar_side_icon_id": "", "avatar": "https://img9.doubanio.com/icon/up53802357-13.jpg", "id": "53802357", "type": "user", "avatar_side_icon": "", "uid": "cintin"}, "url": "https://movie.douban.com/photos/photo/1432320528/", "image": {"large": {"url": "https://qnmob3.doubanio.com/view/photo/large/public/p1432320528.jpg?imageView2/2/q/80/w/600/h/3000/format/webp", "width": 420, "height": 600, "size": 0}, "raw": null, "small": {"url": "https://img9.doubanio.com/view/photo/s/public/p1432320528.webp", "width": 420, "height": 600, "size": 0}, "is_animated": false, "normal": {"url": "https://img9.doubanio.com/view/photo/m/public/p1432320528.webp", "width": 420, "height": 600, "size": 0}}, "uri": "douban://douban.com/photo/1432320528", "create_time": "2012-02-23 23:46:45", "position": 0, "owner_uri": "douban://douban.com/movie/10355343", "type": "photo", "id": "1432320528", "sharing_url": "https://www.douban.com/doubanapp/dispatch?uri=/photo/1432320528/"}, "cover_url": "https://img9.doubanio.com/view/photo/m_ratio_poster/public/p1432320528.webp", "restrictive_icon_url": "", "header_bg_color": "40667f", "is_douban_intro": false, "ticket_vendor_icons": ["https://img9.doubanio.com/view/dale-online/dale_ad/public/0589a62f2f2d7c2.jpg"], "honor_infos": [], "sharing_url": "https://movie.douban.com/subject/10355343/", "subject_collections": [], "countries": ["\u5370\u5ea6 india"], "url": "https://movie.douban.com/subject/10355343/", "release_date": null, "original_title": "London Paris New York", "uri": "douban://douban.com/movie/10355343", "episodes_info": "", "subtype": "movie", "directors": [{"name": "Anu Menon"}], "is_show": false, "in_blacklist": false, "pre_release_desc": "", "video": null, "aka": ["\u4f26\u6566 \u5df4\u9ece \u7ebd\u7ea6"], "is_restrictive": false, "trailer": {"sharing_url": "https://www.douban.com/doubanapp/dispatch?uri=/movie/10355343/trailer%3Ftrailer_id%3D108631%26trailer_type%3DA", "video_url": "https://vt1.doubanio.com/202209191103/04bcb1678daef5a94e6edf447c125504/view/movie/M/301080631.mp4", "title": "\u7f8e\u56fd\u9884\u544a\u7247", "uri": "douban://douban.com/movie/10355343/trailer?trailer_id=108631&trailer_type=A", "cover_url": "https://img9.doubanio.com/img/trailer/medium/1432350003.jpg?", "term_num": 0, "n_comments": 0, "create_time": "2012-02-23", "subject_title": "\u4f26\u6566 \u5df4\u9ece \u7ebd\u7ea6", "file_size": 11799042, "runtime": "02:07", "type": "A", "id": "108631", "desc": ""}, "vendor_icons": [], "extra": {"douban_id": "10355343", "imdb_id": "tt2064849", "backdrops": ["https://www.themoviedb.org/t/p/original/9wIiokFu12WgrEH44qWpmhFfmkl.jpg"]}, "scrap_count": 1}
