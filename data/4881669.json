But we're beginning to venture into places we never thought we'd reach. And the most profound mysteries of science are coming into view. The Extreme Universe gives vital insights into a world we thought we knew, using an unprecedented combination of the most current scientific information, mind-blowing CGI and relevant comparisons and analogies. The night sky is a fascinating spectacle, but for ancient civilisations it was the key to their survival. Over thousands of years, there have been a lot of scientific discoveries, but it was our ancestors' first observations of the cosmos that put us on the path to modern civilisation which led to some of mankind s greatest creations. Are we alone in the vast expanse of the universe? It's a question people have been asking for thousands of years and we're closer than ever to finding the answers. We'll travel deep into the cosmos to witness the most violent impacts in the universe and take you into the heart of the universe's biggest space-storms - weather like 11,000-mile-per-hour winds or storms of raining liquid methane. Planets, moons, and stars are all at risk of violent upheaval. The violence unleashed on these worlds provides a frightening blueprint of what could happen closer to home. No matter how we try, there's no way to prepare for nature s cosmic fury\nPart 1: Is Anyone Out There\nTravel to the farthest reaches of the universe, as this exploratory space documentary series asks 'is anyone out there'?\nPart 2: Collision Course\nWARNING, this episode contains flashing images which may cause Photo Sensitive Epilepsy. Witness some of the most violent impacts in the universe, and meet the people protecting us from the fallout of these cosmic collisions.\nPart 3: Space Storms\nWitness the relentless power of Earth's worst weather, before travelling the universe to find the 17,500kmh winds and methane storms of space.\nPart 4: Edge of Space\nDelve into the unknown on a journey into deep oceans and deep space, as we seek the answers to some of mankind's most unfathomable questions.\nPart 5: Time Bombs\nPlanets, moons and stars can all face violent upheaval at any moment. Is it possible to predict when Mother Nature will strike?\nPart 6: Star Gates\nThroughout history, humans have been fascinated by the stars.
