The programme takes children on a journey of philosophical enquiry with Hugo, its central character. Each episode begins with Hugo asking a \u2018big\u2019 question such as; \u2018What is the difference between thinking and dreaming?\u2019, \u2018Can it ever be good to be angry?\u2019 and \u2018Why do people feel sad?\u2019.\nAs Hugo travels through his beautiful landscape (and sometimes beyond, as he sometimes finds inspiration in outer space) in search of understanding, he meets a range of characters, based on the books of Oscar Brenifier and Jacques Despr\u00e9s.\nAs his understanding develops in each episode, Hugo asks more questions, designed to draw the viewers into a deeper exploration of topics that are meaningful to them, such as friends, beauty, imagination, learning and fairness.\nWe hope that through enjoying Hugo\u2019s adventures in the series, they will also find themselves relating to his experiences and maybe developing questions of their own.\nStudies around the world have shown that regular participation in philosophical enquiry can have a whole host of significant benefits, such as increased academic attainment, better relationships and greater confidence in speaking to others, and many primary schools have started including some elements of philosophy in their curriculums. Children of nursery age and above are being encouraged to think not only creatively and critically, but also caringly (listening to each other\u2019s ideas and respecting differences) and collaboratively (building on each other\u2019s ideas and working together to make more sense of things).", "vendor_icons": [], "year": "2013", "card_subtitle": "2013 / \u82f1\u56fd / \u513f\u7ae5 \u52a8\u753b \u77ed\u7247", "id": "25814538", "is_restrictive": false, "languages": ["\u82f1\u8bed"], "genres": ["\u513f\u7ae5", "\u52a8\u753b", "\u77ed\u7247"], "title": "\u96e8\u679c\u5e26\u4f60\u770b\u4e16\u754c \u7b2c\u4e00\u5b63", "is_released": true, "vendors": [], "actors": [], "episodes_count": 52, "type": "tv", "linewatches": [], "info_url": "https://www.douban.com/doubanapp//h5/movie/25814538/desc", "tags": [], "durations": ["5 min"], "cover": {"description": "", "author": {"loc": {"id": "118254", "name": "\u6b66\u6c49", "uid": "wuhan"}, "kind": "user", "name": "Valerie_Cozy", "url": "https://www.douban.com/people/1654816/", "reg_time": "2007-07-01 22:25:08", "uri": "douban://douban.com/user/1654816", "avatar": "https://img9.doubanio.com/icon/up1654816-4.jpg", "id": "1654816", "type": "user", "avatar_side_icon": "", "uid": "vero6220"}, "url": "https://movie.douban.com/photos/photo/2166962873/", "image": {"large": {"url": "https://img9.doubanio.com/view/photo/l/public/p2166962873.webp", "width": 832, "height": 936, "size": 0}, "raw": null, "small": {"url": "https://img9.doubanio.com/view/photo/s/public/p2166962873.webp", "width": 533, "height": 600, "size": 0}, "is_animated": false, "normal": {"url": "https://img9.doubanio.com/view/photo/m/public/p2166962873.webp", "width": 533, "height": 600, "size": 0}}, "uri": "douban://douban.com/photo/2166962873", "create_time": "2014-01-19 09:18:05", "position": 0, "owner_uri": "douban://douban.com/tv/25814538", "type": "photo", "id": "2166962873", "sharing_url": "https://www.douban.com/doubanapp/dispatch?uri=/photo/2166962873/"}, "cover_url": "https://img9.doubanio.com/view/photo/m_ratio_poster/public/p2166962873.webp", "restrictive_icon_url": "", "header_bg_color": "7f432c", "honor_infos": [], "trailer": null, "sharing_url": "https://movie.douban.com/subject/25814538/", "countries": ["\u82f1\u56fd"], "url": "https://movie.douban.com/subject/25814538/", "release_date": null, "original_title": "What's the big idea Season 1", "uri": "douban://douban.com/tv/25814538", "episodes_info": "", "subtype": "tv", "directors": [], "is_show": false, "in_blacklist": false, "pre_release_desc": "", "video": null, "aka": ["\u5c0f\u670b\u53cb\u5927\u554f\u984c(\u53f0)"], "webisode_count": 0, "null_rating_reason": "", "extra": {"douban_id": "25814538", "imdb_id": "tt2789208", "backdrops": ["https://www.themoviedb.org/t/p/original/y1bOBjiiuFxxmiu84xJjKAGxd.jpg"]}}
