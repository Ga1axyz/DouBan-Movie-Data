St. Petersburg 1917. The frontline of the global war is coming closer everyday; people are hungry, worried, angry. In February the tsar is overthrown. Many artists are euphoric: Revolution! Freedom! Freedom, finally? No. Starting in October, the Bolsheviks rule by themselves. What were poets, thinkers, and avant-gardists like Maxim Gorky and Kazimir Malevich doing during this drastic change of power? In the film, five of them alight from the director's piles of books as animated cut-out figures. With their own recorded words in their mouths, they participate in salons, committees, and street riots: moments during which the outcome of the history is still unknown.", "vendor_icons": [], "year": "2017", "card_subtitle": "2017 / \u5fb7\u56fd \u745e\u58eb / \u4f20\u8bb0 \u52a8\u753b \u7eaa\u5f55\u7247 / Katrin Rothe", "id": "27043483", "is_restrictive": false, "languages": ["\u5fb7\u8bed", "\u82f1\u8bed"], "genres": ["\u4f20\u8bb0", "\u52a8\u753b", "\u7eaa\u5f55\u7247"], "title": "1917\uff1a\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u5341\u6708", "is_released": true, "vendors": [], "actors": [], "episodes_count": 0, "type": "movie", "linewatches": [], "info_url": "https://www.douban.com/doubanapp//h5/movie/27043483/desc", "tags": [], "durations": ["90\u5206\u949f"], "cover": {"description": "", "author": {"loc": {"id": "128171", "name": "Ruhr", "uid": "ruhr"}, "kind": "user", "name": "\u5c0f\u6613\u752b", "url": "https://www.douban.com/people/1748369/", "reg_time": "2007-08-08 13:51:44", "uri": "douban://douban.com/user/1748369", "avatar": "https://img9.doubanio.com/icon/up1748369-112.jpg", "id": "1748369", "type": "user", "avatar_side_icon": "", "uid": "shallwinyee"}, "url": "https://movie.douban.com/photos/photo/2459174166/", "image": {"large": {"url": "https://img9.doubanio.com/view/photo/l/public/p2459174166.webp", "width": 425, "height": 600, "size": 0}, "raw": null, "small": {"url": "https://img9.doubanio.com/view/photo/s/public/p2459174166.webp", "width": 425, "height": 600, "size": 0}, "is_animated": false, "normal": {"url": "https://img9.doubanio.com/view/photo/m/public/p2459174166.webp", "width": 425, "height": 600, "size": 0}}, "uri": "douban://douban.com/photo/2459174166", "create_time": "2017-05-15 02:06:28", "position": 0, "owner_uri": "douban://douban.com/movie/27043483", "type": "photo", "id": "2459174166", "sharing_url": "https://www.douban.com/doubanapp/dispatch?uri=/photo/2459174166/"}, "cover_url": "https://img9.doubanio.com/view/photo/m_ratio_poster/public/p2459174166.webp", "restrictive_icon_url": "", "header_bg_color": "4c2b22", "honor_infos": [], "trailer": null, "sharing_url": "https://movie.douban.com/subject/27043483/", "countries": ["\u5fb7\u56fd", "\u745e\u58eb"], "url": "https://movie.douban.com/subject/27043483/", "release_date": null, "original_title": "1917 - Der wahre Oktober", "uri": "douban://douban.com/movie/27043483", "episodes_info": "", "subtype": "movie", "directors": [{"name": "Katrin Rothe"}], "is_show": false, "in_blacklist": false, "pre_release_desc": "", "video": null, "aka": [], "webisode_count": 0, "null_rating_reason": "\u6682\u65e0\u8bc4\u5206", "extra": {"douban_id": "27043483", "imdb_id": "tt6489962", "backdrops": []}, "noneedrating": 1}
