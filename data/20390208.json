Because of his involvement with Licalsi, and the belief that he withheld evidence that could have given her a longer sentence, Kelly is transferred out of the 15th and chooses to leave the department altogether. He is replaced by Bobby Simone, a widower whose previous job was that of driver for the Police Commissioner. This does not sit well with Sipowicz but in time he learns to accept his new partner and, as his relationship with Sylvia leads down the aisle, asks Simone to be his best man.\nAfter an affair with a journalist who uses information that he gives her in an article, Simone begins a relationship with another new officer in the squad, Diane Russell. Sipowicz, still a recovering alcoholic, recognizes in Russell's behavior that she also has a problem and, after much prompting, she herself goes to AA. Elsewhere, due to his lack of self-belief that a woman like Donna could love him, Medavoy's relationship with her breaks down, due in no small part to Donna's visiting sister.", "webisode_count": 0, "year": "1994", "card_subtitle": "1994 / \u7f8e\u56fd / \u5267\u60c5 \u72af\u7f6a / \u5927\u536b\u00b7\u5361\u7f57\u7d20 \u4e39\u5c3c\u65af\u00b7\u5f17\u5170\u8328", "id": "20390208", "languages": ["\u82f1\u8bed"], "genres": ["\u5267\u60c5", "\u72af\u7f6a"], "review_count": 0, "title": "\u7ebd\u7ea6\u91cd\u6848\u7ec4 \u7b2c\u4e8c\u5b63", "is_released": true, "vendors": [], "actors": [{"name": "\u5927\u536b\u00b7\u5361\u7f57\u7d20"}, {"name": "\u4e39\u5c3c\u65af\u00b7\u5f17\u5170\u8328"}, {"name": "\u8a79\u59c6\u65af\u00b7\u9ea6\u514b\u4e39\u5c3c\u5c14"}], "episodes_count": 22, "type": "tv", "null_rating_reason": "\u6682\u65e0\u8bc4\u5206", "linewatches": [], "info_url": "https://www.douban.com/doubanapp//h5/movie/20390208/desc", "tags": [], "durations": ["45\u5206\u949f"], "cover": null, "cover_url": "https://img9.doubanio.com/f/frodo/568eb8fac54d39fe599b0de8c3f2aee1dbc43cf0/pics/subject/tv_large.jpg", "restrictive_icon_url": "", "header_bg_color": "4a444c", "is_douban_intro": false, "ticket_vendor_icons": ["https://img9.doubanio.com/view/dale-online/dale_ad/public/0589a62f2f2d7c2.jpg"], "honor_infos": [], "sharing_url": "https://movie.douban.com/subject/20390208/", "subject_collections": [], "countries": ["\u7f8e\u56fd"], "url": "https://movie.douban.com/subject/20390208/", "release_date": null, "original_title": "NYPD Blue Season 2", "uri": "douban://douban.com/tv/20390208", "episodes_info": "", "subtype": "tv", "directors": [], "is_show": false, "in_blacklist": false, "pre_release_desc": "", "video": null, "aka": [], "is_restrictive": false, "trailer": null, "vendor_icons": [], "extra": {"douban_id": "20390208", "imdb_id": "tt0656442", "backdrops": []}, "scrap_count": 1}
