Amir, an Uzbek with two wives, gives her shelter in a remote village. The Uzbek has not gone to the front to fight, because he, as he explains, he does not like to kill people. Nevertheless, Amir believes that he is \"defending the motherland\" by looking after and feeding his own family along with the Russian, now his third wife, her two children and little Ivan, his new son from the Russian woman. When the war ends, the woman's husband, who was assumed to be dead, shows up looking for his wife and children. He finds them and returns with them to Sevastopol. But he has difficulty accepting that his wife was third wife of a Muslim man who wouldn't fight in the war and the product of their union, Ivan, who is named after him, is now playing host to Amir's visiting family.", "webisode_count": 0, "year": "2013", "card_subtitle": "2013 / \u4fc4\u7f57\u65af / ", "id": "25705527", "languages": [], "genres": [], "title": "\u963f\u7c73\u5c14\u7684\u513f\u5b50\u4f0a\u4e07", "is_released": true, "vendors": [], "actors": [], "episodes_count": 0, "type": "movie", "null_rating_reason": "\u6682\u65e0\u8bc4\u5206", "linewatches": [], "info_url": "https://www.douban.com/doubanapp//h5/movie/25705527/desc", "tags": [], "durations": ["116\u5206\u949f"], "cover": {"description": "", "author": {"loc": {"id": "118200", "name": "\u798f\u5dde", "uid": "fuzhou"}, "kind": "user", "name": "Unravel", "url": "https://www.douban.com/people/46972163/", "reg_time": "2010-10-27 15:33:08", "uri": "douban://douban.com/user/46972163", "avatar_side_icon_id": "", "avatar": "https://img9.doubanio.com/icon/up46972163-15.jpg", "id": "46972163", "type": "user", "avatar_side_icon": "", "uid": "F1006"}, "url": "https://movie.douban.com/photos/photo/2201768437/", "image": {"large": {"url": "https://img9.doubanio.com/view/photo/l/public/p2201768437.webp", "width": 691, "height": 1000, "size": 0}, "raw": null, "small": {"url": "https://img9.doubanio.com/view/photo/s/public/p2201768437.webp", "width": 414, "height": 600, "size": 0}, "is_animated": false, "normal": {"url": "https://img9.doubanio.com/view/photo/m/public/p2201768437.webp", "width": 414, "height": 600, "size": 0}}, "uri": "douban://douban.com/photo/2201768437", "create_time": "2014-09-25 17:08:56", "position": 2, "owner_uri": "douban://douban.com/movie/25705527", "type": "photo", "id": "2201768437", "sharing_url": "https://www.douban.com/doubanapp/dispatch?uri=/photo/2201768437/"}, "cover_url": "https://img9.doubanio.com/view/photo/m_ratio_poster/public/p2201768437.webp", "restrictive_icon_url": "", "header_bg_color": "4c4138", "honor_infos": [], "sharing_url": "https://movie.douban.com/subject/25705527/", "subject_collections": [], "countries": ["\u4fc4\u7f57\u65af"], "url": "https://movie.douban.com/subject/25705527/", "release_date": null, "original_title": "\u0418\u0432\u0430\u043d, \u0441\u044b\u043d \u0410\u043c\u0438\u0440\u0430", "uri": "douban://douban.com/movie/25705527", "episodes_info": "", "subtype": "movie", "directors": [{"name": ""}], "is_show": false, "in_blacklist": false, "pre_release_desc": "", "video": null, "aka": ["Ivan, syn Amira", "Ivan, Son of Amir"], "is_restrictive": false, "trailer": null, "vendor_icons": []}
