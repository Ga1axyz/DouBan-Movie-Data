For Africa's snakes, chemical weaponry is the name of the game. Africa's Deadliest: snakes follows the continent's apex predators, proving that Africa's beauty only runs skin deep. Behind the veil of greens and glittering golds, lurk perfect killers.\nS5 E2 - Fangs that Kill\nIn Africa the battle for survival rages across some of the most extreme environments on the planet. Here, predators have adapted some of the deadliest weaponry on earth.
