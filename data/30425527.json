Where Do I Come From?\n2. What Makes Me Human?\n3. What Makes Me, Me?\nYou share 99.4% of your genes with your neighbour, 98.7% with a chimp, and even 44% with a fruit fly \u2013 yet you are also entirely unique \u2013 there is nobody else quite like you. In this year\u2019s CHRISTMAS LECTURES, Professor Alice Roberts, and genetics expert Aoife McLysaght, take us on a journey to answer this most fundamental question: Who Am I?\nWe humans tend to view ourselves as separate from the natural world, a special creation even, but we\u2019re far more closely related to the rest of the animal kingdom than you might imagine. From how our limbs evolved from fins, to the colour of our eyes, Alice and Aoife investigate our fascinating evolutionary story to reveal how we became who we are today.\nIn lecture one we explore our animal family, meeting our distant cousins \u2013 from fish to fruit flies \u2013 unearthing clues to our evolutionary past and revealing surprising similarities as we discover our true place in the tree of life.\nLecture two covers the story of our recent evolution from early two-legged hominins to modern humans \u2013 revealing how a humble African ape became a successful global species. Alice and Aoife uncover the story of our journey out of Africa as we spread across the globe, and ask what sets us apart from the other, now extinct, hominin species.\nAnd in lecture three, we see how the interplay between genetic variation and the environment makes us all different \u2013 even identical twins. We\u2019ll interrogate emerging genetic technologies \u2013 from fixing gene errors to personalised medicine \u2013 and ask how far we should go with genetic testing.\nIn all the 2018 CHRISTMAS LECTURES will bring our evolutionary story to life, taking viewers on an immersive voyage through our shared evolutionary past and asking challenging ethical questions about what the future holds.\nThis is the story of us \u2013 our past and our future \u2013 in all its deep-rooted, diverse, and surprising glory.", "webisode_count": 0, "year": "2018", "card_subtitle": "2018 / \u82f1\u56fd / \u7eaa\u5f55\u7247 / \u827e\u4e3d\u4e1d\u00b7\u7f57\u4f2f\u8328 \u5965\u83f2\u00b7\u9ea6\u514b\u83b1\u8428\u7279", "id": "30425527", "languages": ["\u82f1\u8bed"], "genres": ["\u7eaa\u5f55\u7247"], "title": "\u82f1\u56fd\u7687\u5bb6\u79d1\u5b66\u9662\u5723\u8bde\u8bb2\u5ea7 2018: \u6211\u662f\u8c01", "is_released": true, "vendors": [], "actors": [{"name": "\u827e\u4e3d\u4e1d\u00b7\u7f57\u4f2f\u8328", "roles": ["\u6f14\u5458"], "title": "\u827e\u4e3d\u4e1d\u00b7\u7f57\u4f2f\u8328\uff08\u540c\u540d\uff09\u82f1\u56fd,\u5e03\u91cc\u65af\u6258\u5f71\u89c6\u6f14\u5458", "url": "https://movie.douban.com/celebrity/1142719/", "user": null, "character": "\u6f14\u5458", "uri": "douban://douban.com/celebrity/1142719?subject_id=27348585", "avatar": {"large": "https://img9.doubanio.com/view/celebrity/raw/public/p1405795572.02.jpg", "normal": "https://img9.doubanio.com/view/celebrity/raw/public/p1405795572.02.jpg"}, "sharing_url": "https://www.douban.com/doubanapp/dispatch?uri=/celebrity/1142719/", "type": "celebrity", "id": "1142719", "latin_name": "Alice Roberts"}, {"name": "\u5965\u83f2\u00b7\u9ea6\u514b\u83b1\u8428\u7279", "roles": ["\u4e3b\u6301\u4eba"], "title": "\u5965\u83f2\u00b7\u9ea6\u514b\u83b1\u8428\u7279\uff08\u540c\u540d\uff09None\u5f71\u89c6\u6f14\u5458", "url": "https://movie.douban.com/celebrity/1410487/", "user": null, "character": "\u4e3b\u6301\u4eba", "uri": "douban://douban.com/celebrity/1410487?subject_id=30455067", "avatar": {"large": "https://img9.doubanio.com/view/celebrity/raw/public/p6FETb1n7jjocel_avatar_uploaded1549461328.66.jpg", "normal": "https://img9.doubanio.com/view/celebrity/raw/public/p6FETb1n7jjocel_avatar_uploaded1549461328.66.jpg"}, "sharing_url": "https://www.douban.com/doubanapp/dispatch?uri=/celebrity/1410487/", "type": "celebrity", "id": "1410487", "latin_name": "Aoife McLysaght"}], "episodes_count": 3, "type": "tv", "null_rating_reason": "\u6682\u65e0\u8bc4\u5206", "linewatches": [], "info_url": "https://www.douban.com/doubanapp//h5/movie/30425527/desc", "tags": [], "durations": ["59\u5206\u949f"], "cover": {"description": "", "author": {"loc": {"id": "108296", "name": "\u4e0a\u6d77", "uid": "shanghai"}, "kind": "user", "name": "\u5b87\u5b99\u771f\u7406\u732a\u5927\u80a0", "url": "https://www.douban.com/people/1727133/", "reg_time": "2007-07-31 16:57:07", "uri": "douban://douban.com/user/1727133", "avatar_side_icon_id": "119", "avatar": "https://img9.doubanio.com/icon/up1727133-201.jpg", "id": "1727133", "type": "user", "avatar_side_icon": "https://img9.doubanio.com/view/files/raw/file-1663567932.png", "uid": "overload"}, "url": "https://movie.douban.com/photos/photo/2547350383/", "image": {"large": {"url": "https://img9.doubanio.com/view/photo/l/public/p2547350383.webp", "width": 1000, "height": 700, "size": 0}, "raw": null, "small": {"url": "https://img9.doubanio.com/view/photo/s/public/p2547350383.webp", "width": 600, "height": 420, "size": 0}, "normal": {"url": "https://img9.doubanio.com/view/photo/m/public/p2547350383.webp", "width": 600, "height": 420, "size": 0}, "is_animated": false}, "uri": "douban://douban.com/photo/2547350383", "create_time": "2019-02-06 21:58:50", "position": 0, "owner_uri": "douban://douban.com/tv/30425527", "type": "photo", "id": "2547350383", "sharing_url": "https://www.douban.com/doubanapp/dispatch?uri=/photo/2547350383/"}, "cover_url": "https://img9.doubanio.com/view/photo/m_ratio_poster/public/p2547350383.webp", "restrictive_icon_url": "", "header_bg_color": "7f3432", "honor_infos": [], "sharing_url": "https://movie.douban.com/subject/30425527/", "subject_collections": [], "countries": ["\u82f1\u56fd"], "url": "https://movie.douban.com/subject/30425527/", "release_date": null, "original_title": "Royal Institution Christmas Lectures 2018: Who Am I?", "uri": "douban://douban.com/tv/30425527", "episodes_info": "", "subtype": "tv", "directors": [], "is_show": false, "in_blacklist": false, "pre_release_desc": "", "video": null, "aka": [], "is_restrictive": false, "trailer": null, "vendor_icons": []}
