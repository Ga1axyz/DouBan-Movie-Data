It follows Joseph \"Joe\" Gatto, James \"Murr\" Murray, Brian \"Q\" Quinn and Salvatore \"Sal\" Vulcano, the four members of the comedy troupe The Tenderloins as they coerce one another into doing public pranks while being filmed by hidden cameras. The show differs from other prank television programs in that the stars of Impractical Jokers do not know the details of the prank until the moment they are performing it on strangers. While one or two cast-member(s) performs the prank, the other comedians in the troupe are behind the scenes feeding lines to their friend(s) via microphone (with an earpiece). The lines fed to the prankster(s) are meant to create a humorous and awkward exchange between the prankster(s) and the stranger being pranked. In some instances, the jokers create PowerPoint presentations for each other, creating the same kind of humorous effect to trip each other up They also sometimes have to present ridiculous books and products invented by the other jokers. The show holds a TV-14 rating due to strong language (although some of the words are bleeped out), suggestive dialogue/content, and crude humor.", "webisode_count": 0, "year": "2016", "card_subtitle": "2016 / \u7f8e\u56fd / \u559c\u5267 \u7eaa\u5f55\u7247 \u771f\u4eba\u79c0 / Joseph \"Joe\" Gatto James \"Murr\" Murray", "id": "26729943", "languages": ["\u82f1\u8bed"], "genres": ["\u559c\u5267", "\u7eaa\u5f55\u7247", "\u771f\u4eba\u79c0"], "title": "\u597d\u53cb\u4e92\u6574 \u7b2c\u4e94\u5b63", "is_released": true, "vendors": [], "actors": [], "episodes_count": 26, "type": "tv", "null_rating_reason": "\u6682\u65e0\u8bc4\u5206", "linewatches": [], "info_url": "https://www.douban.com/doubanapp//h5/movie/26729943/desc", "tags": [], "durations": ["20\u5206\u9418"], "cover": {"description": "", "author": {"loc": null, "kind": "user", "name": "Old Fart", "url": "https://www.douban.com/people/1017425/", "reg_time": "2005-08-29 16:30:15", "uri": "douban://douban.com/user/1017425", "avatar_side_icon_id": "", "avatar": "https://img9.doubanio.com/icon/up1017425-70.jpg", "id": "1017425", "type": "user", "avatar_side_icon": "", "uid": "laomianren"}, "url": "https://movie.douban.com/photos/photo/2321371144/", "image": {"large": {"url": "https://img9.doubanio.com/view/photo/l/public/p2321371144.webp", "width": 410, "height": 631, "size": 0}, "raw": null, "small": {"url": "https://img9.doubanio.com/view/photo/s/public/p2321371144.webp", "width": 389, "height": 600, "size": 0}, "normal": {"url": "https://img9.doubanio.com/view/photo/m/public/p2321371144.webp", "width": 389, "height": 600, "size": 0}, "is_animated": false}, "uri": "douban://douban.com/photo/2321371144", "create_time": "2016-02-21 18:18:34", "position": 0, "owner_uri": "douban://douban.com/tv/26729943", "type": "photo", "id": "2321371144", "sharing_url": "https://www.douban.com/doubanapp/dispatch?uri=/photo/2321371144/"}, "cover_url": "https://img9.doubanio.com/view/photo/m_ratio_poster/public/p2321371144.webp", "restrictive_icon_url": "", "header_bg_color": "77777f", "honor_infos": [], "sharing_url": "https://movie.douban.com/subject/26729943/", "subject_collections": [], "countries": ["\u7f8e\u56fd"], "url": "https://movie.douban.com/subject/26729943/", "release_date": null, "original_title": "Impractical Jokers Season 5", "uri": "douban://douban.com/tv/26729943", "episodes_info": "", "subtype": "tv", "directors": [], "is_show": true, "in_blacklist": false, "pre_release_desc": "", "video": null, "aka": [], "is_restrictive": false, "trailer": null, "vendor_icons": [], "extra": {"douban_id": "26729943", "imdb_id": "tt5110080", "backdrops": []}}
